Made primarily from water and almonds, along with other ingredients such as orange flower water and cognac, it has a unique flavor that’s more than the sum of its ingredients and something altogether individual. It’s milky and nutty but not cloying. It deepens the flavors of other ingredients and bridges magically between refreshing and savory, creating an ethereal mouthfeel that makes ingredients meld in unexpected ways, and at Death & Co, we use it in many styles of cocktails.","ingredients":["12 ounces toasted almond milk","16 ounces superfine sugar","2½ teaspoons Pierre Ferrand Ambre cognac","2½ teaspoons Lazzaroni amaretto","¼ teaspoon rose water"],"steps":["To make the toasted almond milk, toast 1 cup blanched sliced almonds in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until golden brown.

Thus, producers of liqueurs like crème allowed standards to wane—favoring higher levels sugar over nuance and relying on artificial coloring and oil extracts instead of actual cacao.

Despite its name (zaké is a word for “alcohol”), the beverage is usually alcohol-free or very low-proof. With a restorative nature, amazaké may be enjoyed cold or hot. In the summertime, I enjoy it blended with banana and served cold, or laced with shiozakura for a pleasantly salty refresher. When hot, it is execeptional with green tea—or served with grated ginger, as is customary when people visit temples in the first week of the new year. To make amazaké, rinse 1 cup of short-grain Japanese rice once to remove any debris. Drain and rinse again, this time raking your fingers through the rice, allowing the grains to gently polish themselves. Continue to rinse and flush until the water runs clear. Add the rice to a rice cooker. Fill with water to the 3 cup line. Cook the rice according to the rice cooker instructions, taking care that the water does not boil over. If your rice cooker has a porridge setting, use that, but with water that comes to the 1 cup line rather than the 3 cup measuring line. When the rice is cooked, remove the bowl from the rice cooker and use a rice paddle or spoon to make slices through the rice. This allows air flow, turning the rice over so that it releases its heat. To speed up the process, try using a fan to cool. In 10 to 20 minutes, the rice should reach the optimal temperature. Gradually add 1 cup of water to the rice. Stir to even out and let sit until the temperature comes down to 130°F. This takes about 10 minutes. Once it comes to temperature, crumble in one 200-gram packet of komékōji. It helps to crumble the kōji while it is still in the bag, pressing with your fingers until the pieces are loose. Mix the kōji into the steamed rice, and return the rice bowl to the rice cooker and cover loosely with a clean towel. Set the rice cooker to warm and leave the lid open so that the temperature remains between 130°F and 140°F for 8 hours. Stir occasionally to keep the heat evenly distributed. The amazaké will start to smell sweet with a hint of tang. After 8 hours, remove the bowl from the rice cooker and chill in an ice bath. Blend the rice in a high-powered blender until smooth. Store in the refrigerator.","ingredients":["1 cup short-grrain Japanese rice","1 cup water","1 200-gram packet komékōji"],"steps":[null,{"name":"Grenadine","ingredients":["2 parts pomegranate molasses","1 part pomegranate juice","1 part cane sugar"],"steps":["Before going out to buy the bright red grenadine of childhood Shirley Temples, consider purchasing BG Reynolds or Small Hand Foods grenadine.

The drink was first served at Milan’s Caffè Camparino in 1860, but during Prohibition, tourists and American expats added fizzy soda to the mix and it became known as the Americano. It’s also the first of what turned out to be many signature drinks ordered, in meticulous detail, in Ian Fleming’s 1953 Bond novel, Casino Royale. My favorite Americano had as much to do with the setting in which it was served as the ingredients in the drink itself. I was driving with photographer Ed Anderson from Milan to Friuli on our way to meet the Nonino family, and after hours on the road, we finally reached our lodging for the night. We were staying at Orsone, a bed and breakfast owned by Joe and Lidia Bastianich in Cividale del Friuli. We checked in at the bar and before taking our bags out of the rental car, we took a seat at one of the patio tables overlooking the rolling hills of the vineyards. Simone, our bartender, brought us a round of Americanos (“for the Americanos,” he said with a wink), served in rocks glasses with plenty of ice and a long ribbon of orange zest, leaving the bottles on the table for us to admire. Instead of Campari he had used a brand not available in the United States, the cherry-red Riserva Carlo Alberto Bitter Rouge aperitivo, and a caramel-red-colored Mancino Rosso Amaranto vermouth. We sat in silence, sipping our drinks and picking at a bowl of nuts, as those hours on the road faded into a memory.","ingredients":["1½ ounces Campari","1½ ounces sweet vermouth","Soda water","Garnish: orange half-wheel or orange zest"],"steps":["Build the Campari and sweet vermouth in a highball glass or old-fashioned glass filled with ice.

You can find it in bars, restaurants, and cafés from the north to the south. Much sweeter and not as bitter as Campari, it has a low-alcohol content that makes it the perfect vehicle for daytime drinking, especially during the summer months. Over the past few years, Gruppo Campari, which purchased the Aperol brand in 2003, has worked to make the Aperol spritz catch on with a younger crowd of drinkers with their “Easy as 3, 2, 1” advertising campaign (referring to the drink’s signature proportions of Prosecco, Aperol, and soda water).

His son Maurizio Stocchetto now runs Bar Basso and you’ll still find a menu of “Classic Cocktails from the Old School” behind the bar, including the White Russian, brandy Alexander, Grasshopper, and Gibson, but the Italian cocktail made famous at Basso is the Negroni Sbagliato. Sbagliato means “messed up” or “bungled” in Italian, and as the younger Stocchetto tells it, one night in the late 1960s or early 1970s a bartender had accidentally swapped the gin with a bottle of spumante. When his father was making a customer’s Negroni he reached for the spot on the bar where the gin was always kept but instead added the dry sparkling wine to the mix of Campari and vermouth. “The customer said, ‘Let’s try it.’ And he didn’t complain.” When I asked Stocchetto how many Negroni Sbagliatos he served each day, he just sighed and said “too many.” They normally serve it in a comically large hand-blown stemmed glass, the kind of fishbowl-sized vessel you’re more likely to encounter at a bachelorette party spilling out onto Bourbon Street, but when I ordered one he insisted on making mine in the standard rocks glass. He reminisced about hanging out at the bar as a boy, but he really lit up telling me about his time living in San Francisco in his twenties. His love of the Beats, jazz, and the NHL play-offs remains strong, but he’s particularly entertained by the American fast-food advertisements shown during his beloved hockey games.

I’ve been back to Three Dots and a Dash for more of those, but I had a less tricked-out version at Seattle’s Rob Roy that really sold me on the drink, which was originally created at the Aviary bar at the Kuala Lumpur Hilton around 1979. Though the Jungle Bird was listed in the 1989 New American Bartender’s Guide by John J. Poister, it wasn’t until 2002 that Jeff Berry’s Beachbum Berry’s Intoxica! made it a bartender favorite with a cult following that rivals the Negroni.

The origin story is still up for debate, but after weighing recent updates uncovered by drinks historian David Wondrich, Regan is “absolutely convinced” that there was indeed a Count Camillo Negroni, who, when he requested gin in place of soda water in his Americano at Caffè Casoni in Florence, Italy, gave birth to his namesake cocktail. I struggled with whether or not this drink belongs here or the Aperitivo Cocktail section—but ultimately decided that the assertive presence of gin takes it out of the lower-alcohol aperitivo realm. (That having been said, don’t let me tell you when to enjoy your Negroni.) This ruby-red, equal-parts cocktail of gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth has gone on to become one of the most celebrated, and fetishized, drinks of our time. Variations, with and without Campari, abound, and it has taken on new life in the form of bottled and barrel-aged versions.

He started playing around, putting a couple of drops of Underberg in a Manhattan instead of Angostura, and then it hit him. “I had a dream one night—it’s insane, I get a lot of work done when I sleep.” In a spirited dream rivaling one of Twin Peaks’ Special Agent Dale Cooper’s vision quests, Boelte saw the Trinidad Sour (a modern classic created by New York bartender Giuseppe Gonzalez, which calls for a full ounce of Angostura bitters) and swapped in a whole bottle of Underberg in place of the Angostura.

It isn’t surprising that many American bartenders embracing the use of amaro in cocktails will reach for a classic American spirit like bourbon to pair it with. The amaro sour template allows you to mix and match your bourbon with amaro. I recommend complementing the bourbon with a lighter, user-friendly, gateway amaro like Amaro Lucano, Luxardo Amaro Abano, or Averna rather than going to the dark end of the bracingly medicinal spectrum. Portland bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler makes the self-proclaimed “best amaretto sour in the world,” and I—along with legions of bartenders—agree with him. It’s his updated specs that are on display here, swapping the amaretto for amaro.

The server explained that they used a house-made amaro at the restaurant, which made me eager to learn more. Kyle, it turns out, is Kyle Davidson, head bartender at Publican’s sister restaurant, Blackbird. He told me that his namesake drink was born in 2008, when he was working at both the Violet Hour and the Publican. It’s origin story begins with a Cynar-based cocktail he created called The Art of the Choke, which was later published in the books Rogue Cocktails and Beta Cocktails by Kirk Estopinal and Maksym Pazuniak. When guests at the Publican were over-ordering, he’d suggest this drink to help them push through to the end. Then he found the drink made more of a statement with diners when he batched the drink and brought it to the table in a glass bottle with shot glasses.

Men wore full-length Joe Namath–style fur coats, the bar served updated spins on the Grasshopper and Alabama Slammer, and instead of the regular dinner menu, the kitchen served bespoke TV dinners (though my TV dinners from that era never came with a foie gras entrée). The next day, I was somehow able to see through my fern bar–sized hangover to ask Richard for the recipe for one of my favorite featured drinks of the night, the Bartender on Acid. Mashing together two of his favorite things—tiki ephemera and liquor ads from the 1970s—he was aiming for a tropical cocktail that riffed on the 1970s-era drinks the Swampwater (green Chartreuse, pineapple and lime juices) and Surfer on Acid (Jägermeister, Malibu coconut rum, pineapple juice). The more sophisticated Amaro Nardini adds to the complex, herbal base ingredients along with fresh juices, and a little dry, Cuban-style rum adds structure (a tip he picked up from New Orleans tiki bar Latitude 29). “The cocktail is the drink equivalent of a Tarantino film, borrowing the best the ’70s had to offer and then making it better,” says Richard.","ingredients":["1¼ ounces Kalani coconut rum liqueur","¾ ounce Amaro Nardini","¼ ounce El Dorado cask-aged 3-year Demerara rum","¼ ounce green Chartreuse","¼ ounce freshly squeezed lime juice","¾ ounce freshly squeezed pineapple juice","Garnish: pineapple leaf"],"steps":["Combine all the ingredients except the garnish in a cocktail shaker filled with ice.

Nick Talarico oversees the front of the house and the beverage program for their ever-expanding restaurants and also makes a mean old-fashioned, which he doctors with house-made Shiftless Hog orange bitters. I always love geeking out over cocktails and trying new local spirits and beers with Talarico and he kindly shared the story of the Bitter Swagger with me, a cocktail on the menu at Andrew Michael Italian Kitchen, just across the street from Hog and Hominy. “We had a comedian come in after his show downtown late one Saturday night, and he and I talked for a bit about Nardini amaro. He ended up leaving with a bottle from our stock to take with him on his tour and after he left.” That encounter inspired Nick to add a drink on the menu that focused on amaro as a base spirit, and a pisco sour template did the trick. “It’s a total cocktail nerd drink—amaro, pisco, and egg whites don’t necessarily sell themselves—but that’s the fun of having a few cocktail lists where you can hide your nerdiest drinks,” Talarico says.","ingredients":["1¼ ounces Amaro Nardini","¾ ounce pisco","¼ ounce Cocchi Americano","½ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice","1 egg white"],"steps":["Combine all the ingredients in a cocktail shaker and dry shake (without ice) for at least 10 seconds to fully incorporate the egg white.

We turned the pickled kumquats into an amazing kumquat syrup and ran away with the inspiration.” This led them to a drink that was layered and complex and ultimately a tribute to Chipilo, a town in Puebla, Mexico, founded by immigrants from Veneto, Italy. “We found it the perfect homage to the importance of amaro to the Italian palate, and agave spirit to the Mexican.”\t\tSal de gussano (“worm salt”) is a blend of sea salt, chile peppers, and dried Maguey worms that is often served as a condiment alongside tequila, mezcal, and salsas in Mexico.

I make it a point to return to Seattle at least once a year, and immediately after dropping my bag off at the hotel, I head straight over to the Palace for a late-night Palace Burger Royale and immediately regret ever moving in the first place. Former Palace Kitchen assistant manager Maggie Early created the Cynara and shared its origin story with me. “I had spent a few weeks on Lake Maggiore in Northern Italy with my family the fall before I was working at Palace Kitchen. We went there to spread my father’s ashes on an island on the lake where he had visited a decade before and declared to my mom that he could die happy there.” The rental house where they were staying had a fully stocked bar and that’s where Maggie’s love of Cynar started. The centerpiece of the seemingly simple cocktail is a large, bitters-soaked ice cube that keeps the drink chilled while slowly rounding out the flavor as it melts. “When you first sip the cocktail, it’s sweet, boozy, and pleasant, like all of its liquid components,” Early explains. “As the ice cube starts to melt you get the rounded-out flavors from the bitters. It’s the kind of drink you want to sip slowly and experience the change in flavor.”","ingredients":["1½ ounces bourbon, preferably Buffalo Trace","½ ounce Cynar","½ ounce Aperol","Bitters ice cube","Garnish: orange zest"],"steps":["Build the bourbon, Cynar, and Aperol in a double old-fashioned glass.

Channeling the Cabo-style Mexican Bulldog, I decided to make a frozen margarita with an Underberg bottle in it just to be playful.” After that, it became an off-the-menu hit among the regulars.

As we raised our glasses, Matteo explained that the drink was invented by his mother, Louisa, who nodded in approval after we clinked glasses.

Brazil told me, “He is a big fan of American whiskey and I love a good amaro, so I thought this would be a great way to introduce the distinctive minty, herbal notes of the Nardini amaro to him.” He then amped up the bitters as a key ingredient to bridge the drink, deciding on using three different kinds—orange, cherry, and Peychaud’s—to “highlight their own properties while complementing the others.” Close’s character had just taken a drastic arc toward the dark side on the series and Brazil thought “the cocktail named after him would be a great opportunity for a 'character study of bitters.'”","ingredients":["1½ ounces Rittenhouse rye whiskey","1 ounce Amaro Nardini","3 dashes Woodford Reserve Spiced Cherry Bitters","3 dashes Regans’ Orange Bitters No. 6","2 dashes Peychaud’s Bitters"],"steps":["Combine all the ingredients in a mixing glass filled with ice.

Anna now owns the Seattle Seltzer Company and Joe is a partner at the restaurant Manolin. The Mustache Ride was a drink they collaborated on during the early days of W and C, sparked when the guys on staff started a high-stakes mustache-growing competition. Even customers got in on the action, donning elaborate fake mustaches and laying down odds on staff favorites likely to win. Wallace recalls, “At one point, we even caught a group of women rating the mustaches on the back of their oyster list.” Wallace and Sundberg decided to feed the frenzy with a drink to commemorate the event, and the Mustache Ride was born. “The drink is very similar to a Lion’s Tail, though the replacement of simple syrup with a warming, but not too sweet Grade B maple syrup blows the true classic out of the water,” states Wallace. She was making her own allspice dram but switched to St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram when she couldn’t keep up with the demand. “Bulleit stands up to the complex flavors, but Cynar was really the dark horse in this race,” she continues. “It adds a wonderful mouthfeel that truly completes the cocktail. It ramps the bitterness up to balance out the sweetness.” Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.","ingredients":["1½ ounces bourbon, preferably Bulleit","½ ounce Cynar","¾ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice","½ ounce Joey Sunshine’s Maple Simple Syrup","½ ounce St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram","Garnish: lemon twist and cocktail cherry"],"steps":["Combine all of the ingredients except the garnish in a cocktail shaker filled with ice.

Ross’s equal-parts riff on the classic Last Word started with Amaro Nonino, “my absolute favorite amaro of all time.” The first printed version of the Paper Plane had Campari, but Ross swapped in Aperol for better balance.

St. John Frizell has held a box seat to this spectacle from his perch at his bar Fort Defiance on Van Brunt Street. He recalls the early days of the race as an “unsanctioned, unsponsored, ad hoc race conducted without official permission in the middle of the night on Red Hook’s cobblestone streets,” with a vivid memory of witnessing three stacked tiers of bikes locked to the chain link at the 2010 after-party held at a third-floor walk-up across from the bar.\tThe race got bigger, and with that came sponsorship and additional races around the world in Barcelona, London, and Milan. Frizell commemorated the first Milan race with a special cocktail. “After all, this was the biggest sporting event to happen in Red Hook since Sir Thomas Lipton docked the Shamrock II during the America’s Cup in Erie Basin back in 1899,” he says. He reached for the Zucca Rabarbaro, the Milanese amaro that had just become available in the United States, and put it “front and center” in a lighter drink, so that “you could conceivably ride a bike after having one or two.” This “bitter and juicy highball” has remained on the menu ever since and is one of the greatest hits at Fort Defiance, especially during Crit Week.","ingredients":["1½ ounces Zucca Rabarbaro amaro","½ ounce gin","1½ ounces freshly squeezed grapefruit juice","½ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice","½ ounce simple syrup","Soda water","Garnish: grapefruit twist"],"steps":["Combine all the ingredients except the soda water and the garnish in a cocktail shaker filled with ice.

I was in Milan with photographer Ed Anderson and we had just followed in the footsteps of Verdi and Toscanini, enjoying a civilized aperitivo of an Americano and a Garibaldi while standing at the marble bar at Caffè Camparino in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. We stepped outside the bar, and wanting to avoid the crowds, leaned against the wall and pulled out our phones to look up the address for our next destination. In an instant, a buoyant man decked out in colorful robes whisked between us and greeted us with a hearty “America!” He told us he was from Senegal and that he loved the United States. When he asked where we lived, he smiled and shouted back, “Brooklyn! California!” and more curiously, “Michael Jackson! Michael Jordan!” In the midst of all of this jolly banter, he had not so subtly wrapped a rainbow-colored friendship bracelet snugly around each of our wrists. He insisted they were free but his open palm seemed to imply that wasn’t the case. We may have lost two Euros, but we gained matching souvenirs for the remainder of our trip through Italy. In a nod to the Americano, I’ve paired two herbaceous spirits to represent my journey from Brooklyn to Milan: Campari from Milan and the tart, floral, and hibiscus-based Sorel liqueur made in Red Hook, a stone’s throw from my apartment.

Chris Elford now lives in Seattle, but when he was at Amor y Amargo in 2011 and 2012, he spent months tasting and playing around with the bar’s dozens of bottles of amari on the shelf. He happened to be on a Meletti kick when “an older woman with a gruff voice who seemed like she was no stranger to drinking” came into the bar and ordered “whatever you like to make.” Splitting the bases, rye and gin seemed like “strange but awesome bedfellows,” and the tiki bitters and Orange twist “made the drink pop just right.” And about that name? “I named it the Sharpie Mustache because, well, this drink is very, very boozy—deceptively so—and one of my favorite frat boy inclinations in America is that of drawing a Sharpie mustache on some poor soul who passed out early.

It was kind of slow and I was probably a little hungover.” Mann suggested a shot of Fernet-Branca to help bring them back to life, but as Boelte remembers, “Sometimes, early in the day, Fernet can be kind of aggressive.” Taking a cue from his own cocktail, the Waterfront, he cut the shot with Branca Menta. “We take it and we’re like, ‘Bam! That’s really good.’” Mann agreed, and upon reflection, the name of the drink and the first of many shots was born. “Bill said, ‘You know when your battery is dead and you’ve got to roll down the hill and pop the clutch?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, a hard start.’ And that’s the name of that drink.” One of my proudest accomplishments was introducing Fernet’s Count Edoardo Branca, the sixth generation of his family to make fernet, to this Brooklyn tribute to his family’s product. After giving me a personal tour around the historic Fratelli Branca Distillerie in Milan, we ended up in a room outfitted with a bar stocked with all of their products. “I’m not a bartender, but may I offer you a drink before you leave?” It was still before noon and the sunlight was spilling into the saffron-colored room, but Branca helped set the mood by turning on the neon Fernet-Branca sign that hung over the bottles behind the bar. Seeing bottles of Fernet-Branca and Branca Menta side by side meant only one thing, and I asked the count if he had ever had a Hard Start. And with that, as he poured equal parts of his family’s namesake spirits into our glasses, I had inadvertently sent a bitter boomerang all the way from Carroll Gardens to Milan. He winced watching me shoot it back. “You Americans love your shots. In Italy we still sip fernet.”","ingredients":["¾ ounce Fernet-Branca","¾ ounce Branca Menta"],"steps":["Pour all ingredients into a shot glass.

Palumbo is now working at New York’s Up and Up, but at the time of the Jimbo’s creation he was behind the stick at Extra Fancy. He lived across the street from the bar and would often end up spending late nights developing the drink menu after they closed. After these late-night rounds of R&D, he’d retire to his rooftop across the street and enjoy one last drink as he watched the sun rise (“a nightcap, minus the night”). On one of these occasions, home-bar pickings were slim. “We had basically drunk everything but a bottle of Rittenhouse rye and a bottle of Amaro Meletti.” That combination came back to him a few days later at Extra Fancy, when a pack of twentysomething women spilled into the bar seeking “a round of shots, whiskey shots, but not sweet, and not, like, sour, but strong, but not too strong.” Seeking to quickly please them and send them on their way, he reached for the Rittenhouse and Meletti. After knocking them back, he was greeted with: “That. Was. Fucking. Amazing. What do you call that?” On cue, Palumbo’s colleague leaned in and put his arms around his shoulders. “It’s called the Jimbo. And ladies, this is Jimbo.” “And there it happened. A few days later we poured shots for some close industry friends. They loved it, and from that point on it became the house industry shot. We eventually changed to Overholt because the Rittenhouse was getting people a bit too tipsy at the rate we poured them out.” While the drink is typically just poured into a glass, Palumbo has a specific technique. “The Meletti has to be poured first and then you float the rye on top. Now, is that to say that I always make sure to float the rye? Not even close.” Looking back, he admits, “It’s just been a fun little thing watching this grow from a serendipitous accident on my rooftop into something that people are calling for in other cities.”","ingredients":["¾ ounce Old Overholt Rye Whiskey Whiskey","¾ ounce Amaro Meletti"],"steps":["Pour all ingredients into a shot glass.

The Sazerac got its name in 1850 at Sewell Taylor’s Sazerac Coffee House, named after the Sazerac de Forge et Fils Cognac he was importing and using for his house cocktail. But after a phylloxera epidemic in Europe wreaked havoc on France’s wine grape crops, Cognac became scarce in the United States, and rye became the spirit of choice in the Sazerac. Jim Meehan of PDT attributes his affection for the Sazerac to the drink’s layers of “atmosphere”: “Why do I love Sazeracs so much? I’ve thought about it a lot, and for me it’s about experiencing a Sazerac spatially. You have a big glass. You have a glass that’s rinsed with absinthe. And a cocktail—booze, sugar, bitters, and water—in the midst of that absinthe-rinsed glass. And then that lemon oil.

(Cocktail authority Ted Haigh, a.k.a. “Dr. Cocktail,” author of Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails, points out that the sidecar and margarita are both direct descendants of the brandy crusta.) The garnish calls for the thickly sliced zest of half a lemon dispatched in one continuous swath—what Haigh calls “a skirt of fruit peel”—that’s nestled inside the glass, just peeking above the sugared rim. The size of the glass—a short wine glass or goblet is ideal—is important here.

The name and origin of this cocktail remain as murky as the blackstrap rum used in the drink, but it hails from Barbados and makes great use of falernum, a Caribbean liqueur made from an infusion of rum and sugarcane syrup spiced with ginger, lime, cloves, and almonds. There are plenty of recipes online to experiment with if you’re interested in making your own falernum, which is a staple ingredient in many tropical and tiki drinks, but John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum, which dates back to 1890 according to some, will do the trick. When I asked Keith about the backstory of the Corn ’n’ Oil, he said that most people come to it via the recipe on the back of the John D. Taylor bottle, but, as with many great drinks consumed in Seattle, all roads lead back to Murray Stenson, who helped popularize the drink at the Zig Zag Café, where they doctor it with an extra splash of Coca-Cola. You can substitute another dark rum, but you’ll miss out on the sweet depth and dark molasses flavor of the Cruzan Black Strap. Considering its own Caribbean background, Angostura is the bitters of choice here, but swapping in Bittercube Blackstrap Bitters would be a choice play.","ingredients":["2 ounces blackstrap rum, preferably Cruzan Black Strap","½ ounce John D.

We took a table outside and drank espressos in the hot sun, where the conversation quickly turned to cocktails and, when we noticed a bottle of Mexican Coca-Cola on the next table, the undeniably simple pleasure of the Cuba libre. After a pause, Jonny said, “What are we doing sitting here drinking coffee? There’s got to be a bar nearby.” With that, we grabbed our satchels and walked down the block to F.X. McRory’s, a banquet-hall-sized sports bar bedecked in Seattle Mariners memorabilia, and continued our conversation over a round (or two) of Cuba libres. The classic Cuba libre doesn’t call for bitters, but I can’t resist the combination of Angostura and Coca-Cola. Rather than simply adding a dash of bitters and calling it a day, I wanted to introduce the bitters into the drink via bitters-laced ice cubes, which allow the spiciness of the bitters to seep into the drink as the ice slowly melts.","ingredients":["Several dashes Angostura bitters","1 lime","2 ounces light rum","Mexican Coca-Cola"],"steps":["To make the Angostura ice cubes, fill an ice cube tray with water, add 1 or 2 dashes of Angostura bitters to each section, and freeze.","Cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice into a double old-fashioned or highball glass.

At the same time, “-tini” became the suffix appended to any number of questionable concoctions. The first martinis, served in the late 1800s, were often made with Old Tom gin and sweet vermouth (see the Martinez), but around 1906 the marriage of gin and dry vermouth became the standard. In The Joy of Mixology, Gary Regan points out that around this time a kiss of orange bitters showed up in the drink. Orange bitters remained a part of the dry martini up through the 1930s, but by the 1950s the bitters had disappeared just as the quantity of vermouth trickled down from a healthy pour to a drop to just a vapor.","ingredients":["1½ ounces Plymouth Gin","½ ounce dry vermouth","1 dash orange bitters","Garnish: lemon twist"],"steps":["Combine the gin, vermouth, and bitters in a mixing glass filled with ice.

Regardless of the drink’s true provenance, I have to agree with Gary Regan, who, in The Joy of Mixology, writes: “This drink, I believe, was born of the Manhattan and is the father, or perhaps grandfather, of the Dry Gin Martini.” Later he adds, “Theoretically, at least, the Martinez was a variation on the Manhattan, and the Martini is, for all intents and purposes, a Martinez.” In place of the Old Tom gin, a slightly sweeter gin that was popular in the mid-1800s but dried up after Prohibition, I like to use Ransom Old Tom, which hails from Sheridan, Oregon. What makes Ransom so unique is their use of malted barley-based and corn-based spirits, which they allow to mellow in wine barrels, giving the gin its distinctive straw-colored hue. Note the 2:1 vermouth to gin ratio. Some contemporary versions of this drink flip that ratio, or they split the difference and use equal parts. I encourage you to at least try the original version. It’s sweeter than you might be used to, but never cloying, and aromatic as all hell.

And just as one puts on his favorite seersucker jacket for Derby Day, part of the Southern charm of the mint julep lies in its presentation. Although I’ve had juleps in plastic cups and collins glasses, a silver julep cup is what’s really called for by traditionalists. The fresh mint makes the ultimate aromatic garnish, and the short straw tucked into the drink forces you to get your nose in there to fully experience it with all your senses.","ingredients":["2 sprigs fresh mint","½ ounce Simple syrup","2 dashes Angostura or other aromatic bitters","2½ ounces bourbon","Garnish: 2 or 3 springs fresh mint"],"steps":["Place the 2 sprigs of fresh mint in the palm of one hand and give them a smack with your other hand to wake them up.

This tends to be the most popular account of the drink’s origin, but no matter who was behind it (royalty or not), I like to thank that person every time I lift a Negroni to my lips. Made of equal parts gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth, it’s a simple drink that encourages substitutions (swap Aperol for Campari; use Punt e Mes for your vermouth; introduce Lillet; try different gins). Seattle chef Ethan Stowell is responsible for getting me especially hooked on these. Whenever I dropped by Tavolàta for a late-night nibble and I ran into Ethan, a Negroni would appear in my hands as if by magic. Before moving to Brooklyn, I spent my last week in Seattle eating my way through a gustatory bucket list, and a bowl of rigatoni with spicy sausage and a stiff Negroni at Tavolàta were the first items I ticked off. This drink relies solely on the bitterness of the Campari itself, but you can add a dash of orange bitters to amp up the bitter citrus notes, which are rounded out with the flourish of a flamed orange peel garnish.","ingredients":["1 ounce gin","1 ounce Campari","1 ounce sweet vermouth","1 dash orange bitters (optional)","Garnish: Flamed orange peel"],"steps":["Build all the ingredients except the garnish in an old-fashioned glass filled with ice.

In Vintage Cocktails and Forgotten Spirits, Ted Haigh suggests serving this icy cold with six “goodly dashes” of bitters. I’d start with four and take it up to six if that’s your game. A traditional method of introducing the bitters to the gin is to sprinkle the Angostura into a coupe glass and twist and turn the glass around until the glass is coated. Since warm gin and bitters isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, I prefer to serve the Pink Gin chilled to the bone. Try it.

Morris who first created this adaptation of the whiskey sour at his eponymous bar in Lima, Peru, in the 1920s. The registry at the Morris Bar was filled with high praise from visitors who raved about the signature drink, which used the namesake spirit, pisco, a clear brandy made from muscat grapes brought to Peru and Chile from the Canary Islands in the 1550s by Spanish conquistadors. Recipes flip-flop between using lemon or lime juice, so experiment to see which way you prefer (I like lime). Rather than being mixed into the drink, the bitters are applied to the frothy surface of the drink as an aromatic garnish. Amargo Chuncho bitters out of Peru are billed as the authentic mate for your pisco sour. With a rather floral taste and scent, they lack the spice of Angostura, but if you have a bottle, definitely give them a shot.","ingredients":["2 ounces pisco","1 ounce freshly squeezed lime or lemon juice","½ ounce Simple syrup","1 small egg white","Garnish: 4 drops Angostura bitters or Chuncho bitters"],"steps":["Combine all the ingredients except the garnish in a cocktail shaker and dry shake (without ice) for at least 10 seconds to fully incorporate the egg white.

His autumnal Champagne cocktail, The Long Hello, takes its name from an obscure prog rock album from the mid-1970s. (What, you don’t remember the record’s eight-minute instrumental track “I’ve Lost My Cat”?) Damon originally created the cocktail for New York magazine’s winter wedding issue, where he described it as the perfect drink with which to toast newlyweds. This is easily one of my favorite seasonal celebratory cocktails, simple to make, elegant, and delicious. The pear notes from the St. Germain play well with the apple brandy, and the bitters and grated nutmeg add a hint of Christmas spice, making this a warm, charming, and oh-so-sippable Champagne cocktail.","ingredients":["¾ ounce Clear Creek apple brandy","¾ ounce St-Germain elderflower liqueur","1 dash Fee Brothers Whiskey Barrel–Aged Bitters or Fee Brothers Old Fashion Aromatic Bitters","Chilled Champagne or sparkling wine","Garnish: freshly grated nutmeg"],"steps":["Combine the apple brandy, elderflower liqueur, and bitters in a mixing glass filled with ice and stir until chilled.

Traditionally, a Mexican beer like Corona, Pacifico, or Modelo Especial is used, but you can alter your michelada by using a darker beer, like Negra Modelo. The Hotel San Jose in Austin, Texas—which is the kind of place I could envision myself moving into for an extended period of time, either to finish a novel or to have a full-on breakdown—goes the Tex-Mex route, serving their michelada with Shiner Bock, a local beer from the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, Texas. Bitters aren’t traditionally used in a michelada, but when you’re working with dashes of hot sauce, Maggi sauce (a savory soy sauce-like seasoning with a very distinctive taste, often found in the ethnic foods aisle of the grocery store), and Worcestershire, I believe there’s room for bitters. Any mole bitters makes the cut here, but if you can get your hands on some of the spicier bitters from New Mexico’s The Bitter End, try their Memphis Barbeque or Mexican Mole in this drink.","ingredients":["Lime wedge","1 teaspoon kosher salt","¼ teaspoon chili powder","Juice of 1 lime","2 dashes hot sauce (Tabasco in a pinch, but preferably a Mexican hot sauce such as Cholula)","1 dash Maggi sauce","2 dashes Worcestershire sauce","2 dashes mole bitters","Splash of tomato juice","One 12-ounce bottle of beer, preferably Mexican beer or Shiner Bock","Garnish: lime shell and freshly ground black pepper"],"steps":["Cut a slit in the lime wedge and rub it around the rim of a tall beer glass.

My grandmother was a devout churchgoer, which explains why, during The Dukes of Hazzard, whenever Daisy Duke popped onto the screen in her namesake denim cutoffs, my grandmother would cock an eyebrow and whistle, followed by, “Woo hoo hoo, Mrs. Kitzel!” This was her trademark way of expressing disapproval, and one hour of The Dukes of Hazzard (not to mention Fantasy Island) provoked a lot of whistling from her. As a child I never questioned who this Mrs. Kitzel might be, but it turns out it was a reference to Jack Benny regular Artie Auerbach, who played a character named Mr. Kitzel. Mr. Kitzel was a hot dog vendor, remembered best for his line “Pickle in the middle and the mustard on top!” and for his domineering, never-seen wife, Mrs. Kitzel. Beyond a sip of communion wine, my grandmother was mostly a teetotaler, but on Christmas Eve, when my father uncapped a jug of Bailey’s Irish Cream, she could be counted on to have a nip. It usually took just one sip to get her a little giddy. In that spirit, I present the Mrs. Kitzel, a hot-buttered rum of sorts, something that my grandmother might mistake for a warm cider or tea until the spiced rum kicked in and a hoot of “woo hoo, Mrs. Kitzel!” might come forth. I think it’s a fine drink to have on hand while exchanging presents under the tree, or to sneak into a Thermos for a walk around the neighborhood to take in the Christmas lights on a crisp winter night.","ingredients":["2 ounces spiced rum","1 ounce Amaro Nonino","1 teaspoon brown sugar","1 lemon zest","1 orange zest","3 dashes Urban Moonshine maple bitters or homemade Apple Bitters","Hot apple cider","1 tablespoon unsalted butter","Garnish: cinnamon stick and freshly grated nutmeg"],"steps":["Combine the rum, Amaro Nonino, brown sugar, lemon and Orange peels, and bitters in a mug.

They even have their own crest. If Little Edie and Richie Tenenbaum set up house together, it might look like the Hoveys’. Based on photos on Hollister’s popular blog, I was pleased to see that the Hoveys also like to keep a few bottles of bitters on hand. This twist on a Pimm's No. 1 Cup amps up the gin-based Pimm's No. 1 with an additional slug of British dry gin (Bombay will work, but the Hoveys might call for Old Raj).

It’s the pictures that got small.” When you catch a Saturday matinee with Terry, as soon as the credits begin to roll, he’s ready to hit another theater on the other side of town. The Academy Awards are like Christmas and his birthday rolled into one, but he isn’t one to tolerate the typical Oscar party, where the guests are more interested in “Who are you wearing?” than in who’s going to win Best Supporting Actress. So instead, Terry hosts an Oscar brunch, which allows him to honor the day among friends, while guaranteeing his guests are out the door by the time the preshow countdown starts. And, if there are any stragglers, Terry sends them on their way by tapping on his watch and announcing “tick-tock, tick-tock.” When I finally made the A-list for his Oscar brunch, he told me he would have Champagne on hand for mimosas, but I threw some additional ingredients in my kit in order to mix up a signature drink in honor of the occasion. The orange-forward flavors of this daytime kicker serve as tribute to those neglected mimosas.

Even though I had been served far too many courses to remember—the scribbles in my Moleskine notebook that night went from their normal, barely legible state to cave paintings—I left not with a sense of overstuffed food coma, but rather an enlightened eater’s high. Despite the subzero temperatures that bitter January night, I wasn’t ready to call it quits just yet. A nightcap seemed in order, so I walked over to Ko’s sister restaurant, Ssäm Bar. Don Lee, who spent time at PDT and was then the bar manager for the Momofuku empire, was behind the stick at Ssäm Bar that night, and when I told him I was looking for a post-Ko digestif, he went to work and presented me with the Sawyer, an icy, bitters-soaked twist on a gimlet doctored with nearly thirty dashes of bitters. Don explained that the drink was inspired by wd-50 chef Wylie Dufresne (who loves gin) and was named after Wylie’s daughter. The Sawyer is no longer on the menu at Ssäm Bar, but ask nicely and most of the bartenders will know what you’re after.","ingredients":["2 ounces London Dry gin","½ ounce freshly squeezed lime juice","½ ounce Simple syrup","14 dashes Angostura bitters","7 dashes Peychaud’s Bitters","7 dashes orange bitters, preferably equal parts Fee Brothers West Indian Orange Bitters and Regans’ Orange Bitters No. 6"],"steps":["Combine all the ingredients in a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake until chilled.

Part of the experience is the bus ride out to Taylor, where the mode of transportation used to be two open-air double-decker buses that shot through the moonlit countryside like a Deep South version of Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride, with hip flasks of brown whiskey passed back and forth as tree branches whizzed by overhead. The double-deckers have been retired, with orange school buses taking their place, but the spirit is still there (as are the spirits). The sign at Taylor Grocery reads “Eat or We Both Starve,” and no one leaves hungry, that’s for certain. During my first trip there I spied a stack of homemade preserves by the cash register and left with two pints of scuppernong jelly, something I couldn’t easily find back home. While often used interchangeably with muscadine, scuppernong is a variety of the thick-skinned, slightly musky muscadine grape. Native to the southeastern states, scuppernongs come in hues from light green to bronze, while muscadines are typically a reddish-purple. Both varieties can be enjoyed straight off the vine, reduced to a syrupy glaze, baked into a pie, or made into country wine. North Carolina’s ever-inventive Full Steam Brewery even makes a scuppernong sparkling ale. Taking a cue from the marmalade sour, a drink made popular by barman Jamie Boudreau, I’ve sweetened things up with two spoonfuls of scuppernong jelly and a healthy pour of bourbon. Shaken to within an inch of its life, the result is a frothy tipple that will bring a pucker to your lips.","ingredients":["2 ounces bourbon","2 tablespoons scuppernong or muscadine jelly, jam, or preserves","¾ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice","¼ ounce Simple syrup","2 dashes Fee Brothers Whiskey Barrel-Aged Bitters or Angostura bitters","1 egg white"],"steps":["Combine all the ingredients in a cocktail shaker and dry shake (without ice) to fully incorporate the egg white.

The drink is also a tip of the hat to one of my favorite haunts, Momofuku Ssäm Bar, where David Chang keeps Pavement in heavy rotation, and where shiso pops up in both the food and the drink menus. In fact, Pavement bassist Mark Ibold is a bit of a gastronaut himself.

When I was thinking of a drink for Nissley, I knew that simply spiking an Arnold Palmer wouldn’t do. Tea-infused bourbon is the foundation for the drink, but what really makes it is the smoked citrus I adapted from a technique I picked up from Kat Kinsman, the managing editor at CNN’s food blog, Eatocracy. Kat uses a proper outdoor smoker to enrobe the lemons in a savory smoke, but if (like me) you’re making this in an apartment without a yard, you can use a stovetop smoker (available online or at a kitchen supply store). Just remember to crack open the kitchen window and remove the batteries from any nearby smoke detectors (but don’t forget to put them back in when you’re finished!). For this recipe I typically use whiskey-barrel wood chips. Using other types—pecan, cedar, cherry, maple, hickory, or apple wood—will bring about subtle differences in flavor. A final note: using chocolate bitters here is another nod to Nissley, who, without fail, would roll into lunch meetings at work with a bowl of chili and a tiny carton of chocolate milk… a quirky and seemingly unappetizing pairing that only Nissley could pull off.","ingredients":["2 ounces Tea-Infused Bourbon","3 ounces Smoked Lemonade","Seltzer (optional)","2 dashes chocolate or mole bitters","Garnish: lemon wedge"],"steps":["Combine the tea-infused bourbon and smoked lemonade in an ice-filled cocktail shaker.

But, moonshine or not, don’t be surprised if the outlaw spirit washes over you when you’re drinking the “white dog” (a nickname for white whiskey, an unaged distilled whiskey that remains untouched by the barrel that typically gives whiskey its color). Max Watman wrote a very entertaining book on the topic—Chasing the White Dog: An Amateur Outlaw’s Adventures in Moonshine—and I hope this is a drink Max would approve of. Many white whiskey drinks have names like the Corn Popper or the Hillbilly Highball, but I tried to give my concoction a more urbane, sophisticated twist and a name to match. The “white light” comes from the Dolin Vermouth de Chambéry Blanc, which possesses a bittersweet alpine wash, while the “white heat” sneaks up on you from the corn whiskey. I prefer Kings County Distillery’s corn whiskey here—a newer label based out of a loft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. They opened in April 2010 and are the first whiskey distillery in New York City since Prohibition. Plus, their whiskey comes in a glass hip flask, which I know Max would appreciate.

His guest for the night was the legendary, and legendarily eccentric, film producer Robert Evans, best known for helping bring Love Story and The Godfather to the silver screen. At one point in the interview Anderson asked Evans, “If somebody tells me they really like my tie, what should I do?” Without missing a beat, Evans responded, “If one person tells you they like your tie, that’s okay. If five or six people tell you they like your tie, take it home and shred it. Because background makes foreground. If five people tell me they like my shirt, I’ll never wear it again. Because the shirt’s there to make me look good. Your tie’s there to make you look good.” A classic Evans quote, yes, but it’s also a great metaphor for how bitters work their magic in a drink. Unless you’re drinking something meant to impart bitterness, like the Sawyer, bitters are background players that step aside and let the drink itself be the star. The spicy Moroccan bitters used here lends a touch of the exotic, just like the sterling silver bolo tie Evans wears—the one he bought from a belly dancer in London for $1,000. This twist on the tequila sunrise is named after Evans’s Beverly Hills estate, but it is also a nod to young Evans’s role as bullfighter Pedro Romero in the 1957 film version of The Sun Also Rises, the part that caused producer Darryl Zanuck to announce through a bullhorn, “The kid stays in the picture.

Absinthe is an amazing, high-proof, botanical- laced spirit that, when handled properly, is quite exquisite. Just like gin or Chartreuse or amari, absinthe may take some getting used to, but once you do, it’s a love affair that will last for the ages.

Decades ago, after seeing bartenders in the Midwest add a little DayGlo maraschino corn syrup to their Manhattans, I started playing around with more flavorful liqueurs and syrups to add just a hint of fruit to this classic. The 1846 is what I settled on as one of the strongest contenders. Lingonberry syrup is deliciously light and sweet with a powerful tang, so it’s worth your effort to track it down.

Our canon brand Boker’s is quite different from any commercial example I’ve been able to find, probably because the main flavor ingredient is so expensive. The dash of rich simple syrup included in this recipe is there to counterbalance the thinness that sparkling wine brings, and it is a technique we often use if a cocktail feels “thin” on the palate. For the cocktail nerds among us, this is a variation of Jerry Thomas’s original 1887 Morning Glory recipe.

I dialed back the liqueurs (a lot), but even then, the drink was a little too sweet, which meant we had to adjust the bitters or add some acid. Ascorbic acid was okay, but just a dash of lemon juice made a significant difference in the final product.

Baker Jr.’s 1939 opus, The Gentleman’s Companion: Being an Exotic Drinking Book Or, Around the World with Jigger, Beaker and Flask, an amazing read if you ever have the time. What made his cocktail book so unusual was his style of wrapping the recipes in a snippet of a tale that happened to him on his extensive travels around the world. Needless to say, this one caught my imagination, and surprisingly enough, the recipes were quite tasty to boot. I hadn’t touched this drink in years until I realized I had never heard of a drink named Remember the Alamo. So, when I decided to create one, it had to be a riff on the Maine. Given the proximity of the Alamo to Mexico, tequila needed to be the base spirit. One thing that helps the Remember the Alamo become something transcendent is bottle aging (or put simply, time together in a container), and I achieve this at canon by zapping it for several minutes in our ultrasonic homogenizer. This forces the molecules of the different spirits to become more closely acquainted, in a manner that resembles aging for three to four months in a bottle. We use this technique quite often, and while the homogenization step is not necessary to enjoy this at home, it definitely softens the edges and makes the drink something special.","ingredients":["¼ ounce absinthe","1½ ounces rye","¾ ounce sweet vermouth","⅛ ounce cherry heering liqueur","Cherries, for garnish"],"steps":["Mist the absinthe into a cocktail glass.

That way, we aren’t throwing away lots of juices at the end of every shift. The odd thing is that even though there aren’t many great drinks with orange or grapefruit juice in them, a quality bar will always have both ingredients fresh and at the ready.

Given that soda water was once a luxury, armies during the First World War couldn’t supply the beverage to everyone. Soldiers in the field resolved the soda shortage by looking to the French, who had plentiful Champagne and preferred to drink it rather than have it fall into enemy hands. Naturally, this drink needed a new name, and given the wallop it packed, the French 75 was born.From this simple recipe, we have a world of options at our disposal using the Mr. Potato Head theory.

Order a French 75, and you usually get a cocktail served in a champagne flute with some citrus and a kick. Well, I’m here to tell you this drink is not supposed to be served in a champagne flute. It is a civilized drink that helped British soldiers tough out the First World War while remembering fonder, more peaceful times. While many books will tell you how the French 75 is named after the artillery gun (due to its kick), I'm going to focus on where it came from and how it was adapted during the hardships of war. As hard drinking a lot as we are today, recall that back in the day we used to be professionals at this most luxurious of sports. Drinking wasn’t something that occurred occasionally or on special occasions, drinking was done throughout the day, every day. Many soldiers had alcohol included in their rations, and the British kept a steady supply of rum and gin in the field regardless of how difficult the fighting became. What better source of courage than bottles of booze brought up to the front lines during times of battle? Here’s a simple recipe for the classic French 75 with very few adjustments so you can see how our creative process works at canon. Please serve this tall and iced, like a Collins.

A devout Democrat, Colonel Joe Rickey created his signature drink during the summer of his 1883 campaign. The original Rickey called for rye and not gin. Today a Rickey is a Collins without the sugar and with lime instead of lemon.

Notice we don’t muddle fruit or even have ice in our Old Fashioned, and for good reason. Cocktails fall in and out of fashion, but the Old Fashioned has always been around, surviving Prohibition and the dark decades of bartending that came after. During those woeful times, the Old Fashioned became adulterated, essentially just a watery fruit salad.

Now, there’s a pedigree for you. On the other hand, Leo Engel, the Criterion’s head bartender back in the day, seems to have been the first to publish the original recipe when he authored his classic 1878 bartenders’ guide, American and Other Drinks. Mr. Engel suffered from the dubious distinction of being an American expatriate. It’s always something. So, the Alabazam’s origins are a bit opaque. And it turns out the cocktail has a few opaque ingredients itself, so one would normally expect to give it a shake. We discovered we enjoy the texture much more when it is stirred; it gives a silkier mouthfeel. Deep red rust in tone and with lots of spice from the Angostura, this cocktail will cure what ails you and take you back in time to an era when drinking was about much more than mirthful tipples—it was about following doctor’s orders. This complex drink is one of our first discoveries that bitters don’t have to be relegated to a background note. Instead, they can be front and center. Anyone who uses bitters knows that a teaspoon of Angostura is an enormous amount of an ingredient usually measured in drops and dashes. But, tempered with the sugar and triple sec, it really works here, adding lots of complexity and making this a spicy fall and winter treat, replete with notes of cinnamon and clove. The following is our take on the original recipe.","ingredients":["1½ ounces cognac","½ ounce Combier triple sec","¼ ounce Angostura aromatic bitters","¼ ounce rich simple syrup (see recipe)","¼ ounce fresh lemon juice"],"steps":["In a mixing glass filled with ice, add the cognac, triple sec, bitters, rich simple syrup, and lemon juice.

Suffice to say, this recipe differs from all others. For example, we sauté our brains in butter and then smoke them with Earl Grey tea before infusing them with rum. How can that be a bad thing? To ensure speedy delivery of this drink, we borrow an old trick from the original tiki bars and batch all the ingredients (except the lime) in a bottle kept in the freezer.

Every time one of these masterpieces gets served, we know to expect another rash of orders for it. The attraction is a smoke-filled glass cloche moving through the room, at which time cameras come out and people gesture to their companions to watch. When the Campfire arrives at the table, the cloche is removed with a swirl, allowing the cinnamon-scented smoke to envelop its new owner in cinnamon musk. We then leave the drink with the guest, removing the plate and cloche. The drink itself is delightful, bright, and fresh, with some smoky notes from the “campfire” of cinnamon-soaked French oak as well as the mezcal, finishing with a touch of spice from the habanero in the Campfire Shrub. The smoke from the “campfire” doesn’t so much enter the drink as leave an ever-present aroma of cinnamon: It not only fills the cloche and wafts around the table, but it also clings to the outside of the glass, such that you are still smelling cinnamon right through to the last sip.","ingredients":["2 ounces Del Maguey Vida mezcal","½ ounce Campfire Shrub (see recipe)","½ ounce fresh orange juice","2 dashes Angostura aromatic bitters","3 ounces Cinnamon French Oak (see recipe)"],"steps":["In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, add the mezcal, Campfire Shrub, orange juice, and bitters.

The Khaleesi is an example of using smoke as flavor. By allowing the alcohol to come into direct contact with the smoke, we are able to infuse the smoky strawberry dragon’s blood essence into the alcohol. When working with smoke, we use a Smoking Gun, which is a small device with a heated chamber that delivers cool smoke upon release. You can pick one up online or at a kitchen store for around $100. One needs to be careful when incorporating smoke into cocktails, because smoke tends to get stale quickly. We don’t fill the glass with smoke until the drink is about ready to go out, and we don’t add the alcohol to the smoke-filled glass until the drink is ready to be consumed. Two quick swirls in the glass are all that’s needed to incorporate a lot of smoked flavor.

At canon we serve this drink tableside in one of our many large vintage shakers. It’s a riff on the greatest breakfast drink ever conceived: the Ramos Gin Fizz. Historically, the Ramos was created in New Orleans, where part of the show was built around the shaker being handed down a line of “barmen” whose sole purpose was to shake this concoction all night long. The cost of labor has changed a bit since the 1800s, so we decided to eschew the hard labor and instead use an immersion blender.

Our glassware is stored in freezers. Many different kinds of ice are produced from a battery of different ice machines, allowing us to make everything from crushed ice to 2-inch cubes and larger. This quest for the ultimate cold drink requires us to bring in a large tank of liquid nitrogen and experiment with this ingredient. The Golden Martini is our first and simplest success. We add liquid nitrogen to the coupe immediately before pouring in the chilled and diluted cocktail, then stir until all the liquid nitrogen has disappeared. This creates a martini that is as cold as it can possibly be without changing the state from plasma to a solid. Working with liquid nitrogen may seem like a new technique, but it has been used for culinary purposes since as early as 1890. At -321°F we rapidly chill our cocktail while putting on a fun show for our guests. The liquid nitrogen billows as it changes from a liquid to a gas, all the while getting the drink so cold it begins to turn to slush. A couple more stirs converts this martini slush back into a liquid, but imbued with a very silky texture. It is important to use a gin with plenty of natural oils, because it’s the oils along with the slightly sweetened vermouth that allow the liquid nitrogen to transform this cocktail into one that is luscious and viscous. Another component of this drink is goldwasser liqueur, an herbal made in Germany and Poland with flecks of real 22-karat gold suspended in it.","ingredients":["1½ ounces Old English gin","½ ounce Dolin Vermouth de Chambéry Blanc","¼ ounce goldwasser liqueur","2 dashes orange bitters","Lemon twist, for garnish"],"steps":["Carefully and slowly pour 1 ounce of liquid nitrogen into a coupe glass.","In a mixing glass filled with ice, add the gin, vermouth, goldwasser, and bitters.

This one shows how naming cocktails is something of a perversion for me: Clearly, I’m not ashamed to grasp the lowest hanging fruit. The Plum-Marionberry Shrub is almost drinkable by itself, though it’s a touch sweet.

Speaking of friends, you don’t often find an Irish whiskey and a Scotch whisky married in the same glass, so this recipe is decidedly ecumenical. The rinse and mist of Ardbeg allow this monkey to“smoke” thanks to the excessive, peaty smokiness that Ardbeg exudes. Make sure you properly filter the banana from the Jameson or you will find the mouth-feel of this cocktail becomes very thick and unpleasant. At canon, I put the infusion through a centrifuge to get the viscosity I desire.

The hook with this drink is although it is served ice cold, when it approaches the table it appears to be piping hot because liquid nitrogen “steam” is escaping from the teapot. As with all drinks using liquid nitrogen, it is imperative that none of the liquid nitrogen enters the glass the guest will be sipping from. Therefore, staff must be specially trained and all precautions must be in place to ensure your guests never come in contact with it, as it can be deadly if ingested. This is one of the few drinks we’ve created without using bitters. We want a simple sipper, cool on a hot summer day without overheating your brain or overanalyzing the drink. This one could keep someone guessing for hours. For starters, the Earl Grey gin is house-made. Pimm's No. 1 is an English spirit made with dry gin, fruits, and spices. And the Hendrick’s Quinetum is a quinine cordial.

Carefully and very slowly pour some of the “tea” into one cup, and then the other, repeating until the pot is empty.

I’m a big fan of Chartreuse, so you might want to tame down the portions in your Verte Chaud a little if you are not as mad about French herbals as I am. But, have it be known that Chartreuse and chocolate work wonders together, and how could that be a bad thing? If you light your Chartreuse first, it burns off some of the alcohol, making it much gentler for the newbies to drink. Other unusual Chartreuse combinations include pineapple and banana. Use a good-quality, bitter chocolate, so you can easily adjust the sweetness. If you use a cheap hot chocolate mix, you might find the resulting mixture a tad too sweet. Wet cream is made in the same manner as whipped cream; just stop before the cream becomes stiff. The aeration allows the cream to sit neatly on top of the hot chocolate. You could light the Chartreuse on fire before adding the hot chocolate. This is a showy way of heating the glass before serving. Wet cream is cream that has been agitated enough to float atop other liquids (and is still wet) but not so much that it becomes stiff (and more like canned whipped cream). There should be no peaks with wet cream.","ingredients":["6 ounces prepared hot chocolate","2 ounces green Chartreuse","1 ounce wet cream, for topping"],"steps":["In a hot glass (simply submerge the glass in hot water until hot), add the hot chocolate and Chartreuse.

This cocktail is delivered in a vintage lunch box, alongside a vintage Archie comic book, house-made Fernet “Oreo” cookies (see recipe), and a note from Mom. The idea came from my childhood, when I would sneak to the convenience store on the way to school to buy chocolate milk and some cookies to launch me on a sugar high I relied on to torment my teachers. Before I opened the chocolate milk, I would always shake it as hard as I could, making it more airy and less thick. That’s why I create this drink in a soda siphon: It mimics that shaking. I’ve also chosen nitrogen instead of carbon dioxide to “air” the drink. CO2 breaks down to slightly sour carbonic acid, whereas nitrogen lends a welcome, sweetening touch to the final product.","ingredients":["7 ounces 2% milk","6 ounces cognac","6 ounces distilled water","3 ounces Ardbeg ten years old single malt Scotch","3 ounces Tempus Fugit crème de cacao","3 ounces egg whites","1 ounce heavy cream","½ ounce Angostura aromatic bitters"],"steps":["In a soda siphon charged with 1 N2O charger, add the milk, cognac, water, whiskey, crème de cacao, egg whites, cream, and bitters.

Genever, which is a spirit with centuries of history (think of it as a sort of proto-gin), has a strong malty flavor, almost like an unaged white whiskey.

The Pendennis Old-Fashioned involves muddling an orange wedge and a maraschino cherry with some Angostura bitters-soaked sugar in the bottom of a glass, adding a splash of water from a soda gun to make a quick syrup, then topping it all with bourbon and ice. I’m not going to claim that this retro style of Old-Fashioned doesn’t taste good. It does! It’s just different than what we wanted to make at Cure. We were more interested in an earlier, nineteenth-century version of the drink, which doesn’t involve whole fruit or muddling. In the recipe here, I call for bourbon or rye, and both work. It just depends on what you’re in the mood for. I’ll reach for bourbon if I want a rounder, richer Old-Fashioned, and rye if I’m looking for something thinner and more spiced. Hell, you could even swap in Scotch and use honey syrup  as a sweetener, since Scotch and honey go so beautifully together. Or try an agave spirit like tequila or mezcal and use agave syrup , or an aged rum with a smidge less Demerara syrup.

But Ryan Gannon, one of Cure’s Hall of Fame bartenders, was always a big champion of the drink, and it really caught on for us at Cure as a solid Old-Fashioned variation. I think part of the reason people respond to it is because the brandy and the Bénédictine give it a New Orleans sensibility and shared DNA with the Vieux Carré and the Cocktail à La Louisiane. (Bénédictine, which we call a monastic spirit because its recipe was allegedly first developed by French monks, like Chartreuse, has notes of vanilla bean, baking spices, and citrus peel. It was one of those spirits imported from Europe that New Orleans took a shine to, so you’ll find it in a lot of our classic drinks.)

It ended up being fantastic. “This was in the beginning of the Rogue Cocktails concept,” Kirk says, referring to the game-changing collection of drinks he and Maks Pazuniak wrote and published in 2009. Kirk calls it his “weirdo” cocktail book, but it was full of revolutionary ideas, one of which was that drinks don’t necessarily have to have a base spirit like vodka, gin, or whiskey. “I love the idea of a drink where you look at the recipe and think to yourself, Gross. Or, What could that possibly taste like?” Kirk and Maks’s rogue cocktails basically dared you to drink them. Adding to the mystique was the fact that Kirk’s house-made kümmel looked scary: The jug of liquid with whole caraway seeds floating in it looked, at least according to Kirk, like “a million dead flies stuck in a gross brown liquid.” Now that I’ve definitely sold you on this drink, I have to tell you in all honesty that it’s really good.

The Bénédictine was a way to bridge the chocolaty vibes of the tequila, and the crème de menthe adds mint but also a drying, refreshing, cooling note. When a drink is a little sweet, a touch of mint can bring it back down and make you want to take another sip.” Kirk’s Old-Fashioned philosophy is that the setup should fundamentally elevate the base spirit.

A bit of simple syrup could also work instead of the orgeat. (In either case, you should add even more Peychaud’s, for balance.)

According to Arthur—and this is one of those rare instances where I think he got the story mostly right—the drink was invented by Walter Bergeron at the Hotel Monteleone, presumably in the years just following the repeal of Prohibition. Back then, the now-famous revolving Carousel Bar was just a twinkle in some marketing executive’s eye, so guests would have enjoyed their Vieux Carrés gyration-free. That said, we can’t be entirely sure of when Bergeron first created the Vieux Carré. During Prohibition, he was the manager of a “cigar shop” that was raided in 1924. Bergeron was arrested for a gambling-related crime, but it’s not hard to believe that he was slinging illegal hooch—Vieux Carrés, maybe?—in addition to cigars. Remember, New Orleans was called the “wettest city in America” during Prohibition (see this page), so maybe Bergeron was lucky and his arresting officer was a Vieux Carré fan willing to turn a blind eye. Our spec at Cure is pretty close to the classic formula, which blends American rye, Italian sweet vermouth, Caribbean bitters, French cognac, and the French liqueur Bénédictine. Some people like to say that the drink is a tribute to the diversity of the French Quarter (vieux carré means “old square”) in those days when people of French, Italian, and Creole descent all lived side by side. One last thing: If you studied French in school, you’ll probably pronounce this “v-yoo car-ay.” But in New Orleans we say “voo car-ay,” because, well, it’s New Orleans and we mispronounce everything.","ingredients":["¾ ounce (22.5 ml) Sazerac rye","¾ ounce (22.5 ml) Cinzano Rosso vermouth","¾ ounce (22.5 ml) Pierre Ferrand 1840 cognac","¼ ounce (7.5 ml) Bénédictine","14 drops Angostura bitters","14 drops Peychaud’s bitters","Lemon peel, for garnish"],"steps":["Build the drink in a chilled double old-fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube or a few 1¼-inch (3-cm) pieces of ice.

For that reason, I always assumed that the drink was a sort of marketing ploy by the restaurant La Louisiane. They saw how well the Hotel Monteleone, which was just around the corner, was doing with their Vieux Carrés and decided that they needed a house cocktail, too. So they split the difference between the Vieux Carré and the other famous New Orleans drink, the Sazerac, and basically created the Cronut of cocktails. (They took two things that are outstanding on their own and combined them into something that is . . . edible, but does it really need to exist in the world? That said, many people love a Cronut and many love the Vieux Carré, so I encourage you to give the drink a try, even if it isn’t quite on the same level as other New Orleans classics.) Like so many of my well-reasoned cocktail theories, this one is damn hard to prove. The issue is, some people are convinced that the Cocktail à la Louisiane actually predates the Vieux Carré, since the restaurant La Louisiane opened in 1881, and in theory, the cocktail could have hit the menu before Prohibition. One way to triangulate when the drink was created would be to figure out when Bénédictine, one of its key ingredients, first entered the New Orleans market. For this, I turned to my friend the cocktail scholar Wayne Curtis, who found a print ad for Bénédictine in a New Orleans newspaper in 1938. But, Curtis jokes, that only narrows down the time frame “plus or minus fifty years.” I don’t know if we’ll ever be able to state with certainty which came first, the Vieux Carré or the Cocktail à la Louisiane. In the grand spirit of Stanley Clisby Arthur, I’ll share another wild theory that will be impossible for me to prove: What if both cocktails were invented at the same time, specifically for Famous New Orleans Drinks? I could totally see our man Arthur going to both the Monteleone and La Louisiane and telling them that if they whipped up something special for him, he’d include it in his book.

Even so, I hope we never have any Portuguese-speaking guests in the bar when this one is on the menu. The drink kind of straddles the line between a martini and a Manhattan: It’s got great depth of flavor, but it’s still very acidic and snappy. At Cure, we love to play around in the gray area between drink categories. Pagès is kind of hard to come by, but it has Chartreuse-like qualities. If you can’t find it, Kirk suggests subbing in a mix of green and Yellow Chartreuse (or just yellow in a pinch).

Today, you can order a Brûlot at any number of old-school spots such as Antoine’s, Arnaud’s, Galatoire’s, or Commander’s. The recipe varies slightly from place to place, but the gist of it is the same: Cut an entire orange peel into a horse’s neck-style garnish, stud it with cloves, and wrap it around the tines of a fork. Place brandy (which is often infused with cinnamon and citrus and sometimes augmented with kirsch or orange liqueur) in the bowl of a special apparatus called a brûlot set. Light the brandy on fire, then, using a ladle, spoon the flaming brandy over the studded orange peel. The citrus oils should ignite and provide a nice little fireworks display for your guests. Pour coffee into the bowl with the brandy to extinguish the flame, then sweeten the mixture with sugar before serving. The Valley Below, by contrast, “involves considerably less pomp and pageantry,” Genevieve tells me. She turned to our friends at HiVolt Coffee, a locally owned spot just off of Magazine Street in the Lower Garden District, and decided to use their cold brew concentrate (made with Counter Culture coffee) in a drink.

Given how much early New Orleanians loved wormwood-flavored absinthes, I like to imagine this drink might have been a hit, even back in the day.

Here’s the difference, though: I find the Hand Grenade, a sickly sweet melon concoction, pretty irredeemable. But there’s a time and a place for a frozen daiquiri, and I really like a well-made Hurricane. The Hurricane was invented at Pat O’Brien’s, a French Quarter institution that has officially been around since 1933. (Although ol’ Pat was almost certainly running a speakeasy during Prohibition: Someone once asked me to check out the old speakeasy’s location on Royal Street and St. Peter for a potential new bar.) Today, it’s a bit of a tourist trap, but if you’re in the market for dueling pianos and a flaming, neon-lit fountain, it’s worth a visit. The Hurricane is still Pat O’Brien’s signature drink. Legend has it that it was created in the 1940s when domestic spirits like whiskey were scarce but Caribbean rum was plentiful, so distributors essentially told their accounts that if they wanted the good stuff like bourbon, they had to buy large quantities of rum, too. The Hurricane was created as a way to move the cases of rum that were collecting dust. These days you can buy Pat O’Brien’s premade Hurricane mix in powdered or liquid form. I won’t speculate as to what they use to prepare their drinks at the restaurant, but I do know this: I don’t want to drink a cocktail that comes from a packet, like Kool-Aid. Our resident cocktail genius, Kirk, decided one day to reverse-engineer a Hurricane using premium rum and natural ingredients. It’s incredible and does really well at Cane & Table. You have two options when you make it at home: You can make his tropical Hurricane Syrup from scratch using passion fruit puree and guava jelly, or you can buy a high-quality fassionola, the tropical fruity syrup that is essential in this drink (and some tiki drinks), from a reputable source like Cocktail & Sons.

When Haus Alpenz started importing Batavia-Arrack Van Oosten to the United States, a lot of bartenders didn’t know what to do with it. But Maks, who was one of our opening bartenders at Cure and now co-owns the bar Jupiter Disco in Brooklyn, is the type of guy who’s always up for a challenge.

If you can’t find orange flower water in the baking aisle of your grocery store, look for it in Middle Eastern markets. It’s one of the more ingenious aspects of Ramos’s recipe and part of what separates his gin fizz from other egg-white drinks of the era. Orange flower water is a finicky ingredient that, if overused, has the potential to make cocktails cloying and perfumy. But in small doses, it adds this really enticing and unexpected floral note. If your orange flower water is really fresh and smells strong, you may wish to reduce the number of drops to three; if it’s more muted, keep to seven. In the case of the Ramos Gin Fizz, it helps to tamp down the sulfurous, wet-dog smell you sometimes get from egg-white drinks.

At home, go to a reputable independent wine shop and ask the staff to help you pick out a good-quality sparkler ($15 is the minimum you’re likely to spend) that isn’t too sweet and will work well in cocktails.

It's this technique-rinsing the glass with a highly aromatic spirit-that \nsets a Sazerac apart and defines it and the variations on it that follow.

In our Old-Fashioned, the water comes from a bit of dilution, both while stirring the ingredients over ice and as the chunk of ice in the cocktail melts a bit. A toddy, then, is really just an Old-Fashioned that swaps in hot water for cold. This takes the cocktail in a different direction for two key reasons. First, heat increases the perception of alcohol. If you were to take the same amount of water present in a properly diluted Old-Fashioned about 1 ounce-and warm it along with the spirit, sweetener, and bitters, you'd have a cocktail with an intensely alcoholic and unpleasant flavor. So for toddies the drink is lengthened. We've found that 4 ounces of water to 2 ounces of spirit is a good baseline. Second, alcohol evaporates when heated, so when you drink a hot toddy, the volatile aromas will rise to your nose before you take your first sip. This can be off-putting if the drink is too high in proof, but it also allows the drink maker to play with aromas, whether infused into a spirit or inherent in it. Calvados, for example, is ethereal when heated, with a warming perfume that's almost reminiscent of putting on a thick sweater. Because toddies are both heated and more diluted than other cocktails, they require a bit more sweetener and seasoning than Old-Fashioneds; otherwise, they feel thin. The small amount of lemon juice in the drink doesn't make it acidic; rather, it helps season the cocktail and bring the other components into harmony.","ingredients":["2 lemon wedges","1½ ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon","¾ ounce Honey Syrup","1 dash Angostura bitters","4 ounces boiling water","Garnish: 2 lemon wedges and nutmeg"],"steps":["Squeeze the lemon wedges into a toddy mug, then add the remaining ingredients (except the water)","Pour in the boiling water, then grate some nutmeg over the top of the drink and garnish with the lemon wedges"],"tags":["death & co","citrus","stirred","classic"]},{"name":"In Hot Water","author":"Brittany Fells","year":2014,"notes":"If a traditional Hot Toddy isn't wintry enough for you, try this version, which was developed for the Rose, in chilly Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Third, instead of shaking the \ndrink, we use a technique called whipping: shaking the drink with a few pieces of crushed \nice—just enough to mix the ingredients without diluting them too much. After all, there's no \nneed to chill the cocktail as much as one served neat, since it's served over so much crushed \nice, which will also serve the function of diluting the drink.

These can be expressed from twists, but they can also be incorporated via muddling. The Brazilian Caipirinha, which includes almost an entire lime, provides a great opportunity to consider the finer details of muddling citrus. When we cut lime wedges to garnish a drink, we do so in such a way that they're easy to squeeze into a cocktail, cutting them into wedges from the top to the bottom of the lime. But for muddling, we prefer to cut them into pieces of a size and shape that make it easy to extract both the juice and the oils in the skin with one even pressing. So first we cut the lime in half across the middle, then we place the halves on a cutting board cut side down and slice them into quarters. The lime is then muddled with sugar, which helps extract flavor from the lime skin. We prefer to use a sugar cube because it cuts into the lime skin to bring out more of its oils. We recommend putting the sugar cube in a small shaker tin, then adding the lime and simple syrup. Muddle each piece of lime by pressing down and twisting slightly to flatten the lime and break down the sugar. Stop muddling as soon as all of the pieces have been crushed. Although we're typically militant about never pouring the ice we shake a cocktail with into the serving glass, we make an exception for the Caipirinha, which is traditionally served with not just the ice, but also the muddled lime. This allows the lime to continue to flavor the cocktail—though they can get bitter, we find that it's a pleasant limey flavor that builds toward the end of the cocktail. The brightly colored citrus also looks beautiful in a glass.","ingredients":["1 lime","¾ ounce simple syrup","1 sugar cube","2 ounces cachaça"],"steps":["Cut the lime in half crosswise, then cut each half into quarters","Put 6 of the pieces in a shaker, reserving the other 2 for another use","Add the simple syrup and sugar cube and gently muddle the lime, carefully pressing each piece","Add the cachaça and shake with ice, then dump into a double Old Fashioned glass","No garnish"],"tags":["death & co","stirred","citrus","classic"]},{"name":"Tom Collins","notes":"Another type of drink in the Daiquiri's extended family is sours that have bubbly ingredients \nadded. This is such a broad category that it has several subfamilies: Collins-style drinks, \nfizzes, and numerous cocktails that include sparkling wine. We'll start with the Collins, \nwhich is basically a sour served in a tall glass with ice and seltzer. The biggest challenge \nin preparing a Collins is avoiding over-dilution. We like our Collinses as fizzy as possible, \nso rather than shaking them to full dilution, as for sours, we short shake them-just long \nenough to chill the ingredients without adding too much dilution, about five seconds. This \nleaves more room for the seltzer. Traditionally, Collins-style drinks are topped with seltzer \nthat isn't stirred into the drink. We view this as less than ideal. When the drink is sipped \nthrough a straw, the experience is often like drinking a sour that gradually dilutes and may \nnot be bubbly at all. Our preferred method is to add a measured portion of seltzer to the \nempty serving glass, then pour in the contents of the shaker, an action that effectively \nmixes the cocktail, and then add ice at the very end-no stirring required. To make the best \nCollins, use seltzer that's as cold as possible: keep it refrigerated and sealed before use \nor, better yet, build a carbonating rig and make your own very cold and highly sparkling \nseltzer (see page 232). Room temperature seltzer is a waste of time; the bubbles will escape \nquickly and the seltzer will become flat.

The Cosmo is a Sidecar that swaps citrus vodka for the Cognac and lime juice for the lemon, with a small amount of cranberry juice added. Where this drink can and often does go wrong is in using cranberry cocktail and adding too much of it. This makes the whole thing a sweet mess, which may be tasty for people unaccustomed to strong spirits, but it robs the cocktail of complexity, sophistication, and balance. Though cranberry cocktail is the ingredient originally called for in Cosmopolitans, we encourage you to try a version made with pure, unsweetened cranberry juice. Admittedly, it is very tannic and behaves quite differently in cocktails, so for our version, we balance the cranberry juice with an equal amount of simple syrup, and then increase the amount of vodka slightly to help it punch through the tart sweetness.","ingredients":["2 ounces citrus vodka","¾ ounce Cointreau","½ ounce fresh lime juice","1½ ounce pure, unsweetened cranberry juice","½ ounce simple syrup","Garnish: lime wheel"],"steps":["Shake all the ingredients with ice, then double strain into a chilled coupe","Garnish with the lime wheel"],"tags":["death & co","shaken","classic"]},{"name":"Clarified Cosmopolitan","author":"Devon Tarby & Alex Day","year":2015,"notes":"To make our ideal Cosmopolitan, we stick with high-quality ingredients and use clarified lime juice to mimic the clarity of what most folks know as a \"Cosmo,\" minus the Rose's Lime Juice and crappy cranberry cocktail.

The core spirit is also crucial to making this cocktail work: rum's sugarcane backbone complements the cola's round spice flavors, and whisky's spice can work wonderfully with cola's bitter and citrus flavors, but the subtlety of vodka would fall flat, and gin's botanicals would clash with the mixer.\n","ingredients":["2 ounces white rum","¼ ounce fresh lime juice","4 ounces cold Coca-Cola","Garnish: 1 lime wedge"],"steps":["Pour the rum into a Highball glass, then add 3 ice cubes","Stir for 3 seconds","Add the lime juice and cola and stir once","Garnish with the lime wedge"],"tags":["death & co","classic","citrus","stirred"]},{"name":"Negroni Sbagliato","notes":"Remember the Americano from the section \"Experimenting with the Core and Seasoning\"?

Another pet peeve of ours is Bloody Marys with a grainy texture or particulates, such as spices or horseradish. So for this Bloody Mary mix, we forgo spices or horseradish and instead use a bit of fresh celery juice and bell pepper juice.

Another popular variation is the classic Brandy Flip. For our ideal version of this drink, we first fine-tune the core, choosing the woodsy juiciness of Cognac, which works well with the fattiness of the egg. Then, although some recipes for this drink do call for a full 2 ounces of brandy, we think the brandy's higher proof calls for dialing back on the spirits a bit: too much alcohol in a Flip and it just tastes like creamy hooch. Finally, we increase the amount of sweetener slightly to compensate for the oloroso sherry's missing sweetness.\n","ingredients":["1½ ounces Cognac","¾ ounce Demerara Gum Syrup","1 whole egg","Garnish: Nutmeg"],"steps":["Dry shake all the ingredients, then shake again with ice","Double strain into a chilled coupe","Garnish with a few grates of nutmeg"],"tags":["death & co","shaken","classic"]},{"name":"Coffee Cocktail","notes":"According to Jerry Thomas's 1887 Bar-Tender's Guide, this cocktail's name has nothing to do with its flavor (where's the coffee, after all?), but rather its appearance: it looks like a cup of coffee. Lucky for us, cocktail naming has come a long way in the past 150 years. Regardless, the drink is a great example of how the Flip's core can be split between a fortified wine and a spirit, marrying both the root, sherry-based Flip and the Brandy Flip above. Here, tawny port brings both a great deal of flavor and sweetness requiring less syrup to balance-while the Cognac supports it with woodsy complexity.\n","ingredients":["1½ ounces tawny port","1 ounce Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac","¼ ounce simple syrup","1 whole egg","Garnish: Nutmeg"],"steps":["Dry shake all the ingredients, then shake again with ice","Double strain into a chilled coupe","Garnish with a few grates of nutmeg"],"tags":["death & co","shaken","classic"]},{"name":"Eggnog","notes":"Dairy is a natural companion to the richness of an egg.

Perhaps the most famous of these is the Alexander, which itself has many variations based on different core spirits. Our favorite is the classic Brandy Alexander, a mixture of brandy, crème de cacao, and heavy cream, where a rich liqueur serves as the sweetener. As in our take on the Brandy Flip (page 252), we favor a rich Cognac in this drink. Note that because the cocktail has a slightly higher alcohol content, it must be shaken a bit longer so it will be diluted enough to fill a standard coupe.","ingredients":["1½ ounces Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac","1 ounce Giffard white crème de cacao","1 ounce heavy cream","Garnish: Nutmeg"],"steps":["Shake all the ingredients with ice","Double strain into a chilled coupe","Garnish with a few grates of nutmeg"],"tags":["death & co","shaken","classic"]},{"name":"New York Flip","notes":"Eggnog and other nogs have inspired a whole host of cocktails that incorporate both egg and cream.

Like many other classic drinks in this chapter, the White Russian is often derided, but it's actually more carefully balanced than its reputation suggests.

Though decadent, the toasted nuttiness of the pecan-infused rum and the implicit richness of the brown butter-infused brandy are balanced by the fig bomb of the Pedro Ximénez sherry. The maple-flavored whipped cream is one of our favorite revelations, with just a small amount of maple syrup flavoring the cream in a delicious way. We've also played with flavoring whipped cream with other ingredients, including orange curaçao and dry sherry.

Ah, yes, the time of year when bright-hued Meyer lemons make regular old lemons hide with shame, when it’s not just grapefruits but also pomelos and flame grapefruits.

It went great (Mom—I know you had the best intentions!). So, you can imagine how little soda we drank. I got one Coca-Cola on my birthday, one Shirley Temple when we went to our favorite Chinese restaurant when we visited my grandmother each year, and one root beer float to accompany burgers at our yearly pilgrimage to Smokehouse. I treated that root beer float as if God had presented herself to me in drink form. To this day, an ice-cold root beer, preferably over a mountain of crushed ice, is my favorite soda treat.

Now, I have a lot of feelings about aquavit—adoration, love, obsession, to name a few. It’s bright yet also intensely earthy and can be dressed up to look either very serious or playful and carefree. As the flavor profile of aquavit is very bold, it needs equally intense flavors to play with, and so I immediately reached for my bottle of carrot eau de vie. Oh, you don’t have a bottle of carrot eau de vie lying around? Well, you should, because it’s magic in a bottle.

Because my palate craves bright, bitter, juicy citrus with the bittersweet voluptuous qualities of Aperol.

One version I gleefully slurped was garnished with a Luxardo maraschino cherry, and it was that combination that inspired this cocktail. Honestly, this is one of my favorite recipes in this collection of many, and I’d love for you to just stop reading and make one for yourself, so please, don’t let me stand in your way.","ingredients":["1½ ounces umeshu","1 ounce cold brew coffee","½ ounce oloroso sherry","Tonic water, to top","Garnish: Plum fan"],"steps":["Combine the umeshu, coffee, sherry, and tonic water in a highball glass filled with cubed ice.

Few things make such a big impact in such a small package. It adds a completely unexpected layer of flavor without hijacking the rest of the ingredients. I always think of it as a sort of wink at the end of a story, a little secret between my closest inner circle and myself. Here, the small pour of scotch, or as I like to call it smoky honey juice, is accompanied by a minuscule pour of potent, lush, and almost candy-like peach liqueur, creating a combination so highbrow/lowbrow, I almost can’t stand it. This cocktail is for my sister, Alma, who I feel like would read this list of ingredients and be tickled.

I haven’t been back to Germany in a long time to be able to check ye old walk in the Black Forest off my bucket list yet, so in its place I made a cocktail inspired by what I imagine this walk would be like.

It’s tart yet silky. The combination of pommeau and Cocchi Americano creates an apple flavor that’s ripe and crunchy yet somehow caramelized and baked.

Maybe that’s just because we all have this preconceived notion that Cognac is very fancy-pants, which, yeah, okay, it is, but fancy shouldn’t mean inaccessible. This recipe calls for a tiny measure of that good stuff, which gives the sherry and vermouth that extra va-va-voom factor. I'm not a cigar smoking kind of girl, but if I were, I would, with 100 percent certainty, pair my mighty puffing stick with this beverage. I’d also like to point out that this is one of those drinks where glassware makes an impact.

In place of pisco, I’ve enlisted the forces of what shall here on out be known as the Grapey Triumvirate: Floc de Gascogne, Singani, and grappa. I find that both Pisco and FDG have these totally wild floral notes, while Singani is like diving into a bouquet of blossoming pink roses. The grappa, on the other hand, is a bit more rugged and gives the drink a little edge. It’s fascinating to compare three entirely different spirits, from opposite sides of the world, all made from the same raw material, and see how they can complement and extract new flavors from each other. While you will most certainly need to activate your imagination to experience this parallel Pisco Sour universe, it is precisely imagination that we adults could use more of in our daily lives.","ingredients":["2½ ounces white Floc de Gascogne","½ ounce Singani (preferably Singani 63)","1 teaspoon Clear Creek Pinot Grigio Grappa","1 drop eucalyptus extract","Garnish: Lime twist"],"steps":["Combine the Floc de Gascogne, Singani, grappa, and eucalyptus extract in a chilled mixing glass.

This imparts a faintly warm, toasty flavor. The aroma, for me, conjures up the same feeling people get when they smell a pile of raked leaves burning on a fall afternoon. It is the essence of the season. In this cocktail, I use toasted jasmine tea to evoke the same sense memory. To provide a citrus kick, I use pomelo, which is an enormous grapefruit-like fruit. Its zest is very aromatic, so we incorporate it in a syrup. The flesh is rather dry and doesn’t produce a lot of juice when squeezed, so we dehydrate it and blend it with salt to use as a tasty garnish.","ingredients":["1½ ounces Olmeca Altos Plata tequila","¾ ounce ruby grapefruit juice","¼ ounce yuzu juice","¾ ounce Toasted Jasmine-Pomelo Syrup","Soda water, chilled","Garnish: Smoked Pomelo Salt"],"steps":["Combine the tequila, grapefruit juice, yuzu juice, and syrup in a highball glass with an ice spear or a stack of ice cubes.

Its vibrant green hue comes from Midori reinforced by matcha. Midori, popular here during the Days of Disco, is an emerald-colored, muskmelon flavored liqueur. Absolut Lime vodka, a housemade matcha-lime cordial, and a blend of the juice of limes and sudachi, a Japanese citrus fruit with a zesty, sour tang, make for a uniquely tart sipping experience. Interestingly, Midori has an intimate connection to Saturday Night Fever, the film that helped usher in the aforementioned glittery era and catapulted John Travolta to movie stardom. The movie premiered in Manhattan, and the afterparty was held at Ian Schrager’s legendary Studio 54, where, earlier that evening, Midori was introduced to the US for the very first time.

The tea’s bergamot citrus notes really bring out the sweet aromatics of the apple. A bit of sherry and umeshu, Japan’s iconic plum liqueur, lengthen and lighten the drink.

Over the years, I have been asked numerous times to make this drink, which is basically a vodka martini with sake substituted for the dry vermouth. The sake typically makes the drink a bit sweeter and rounder. For our rendition, I wanted to create a cocktail that honored the Japanese traditional sake serve and the classic dry martini. Hinoki is the Japanese cypress that is used to make the masu, the wooden cup used to serve sake. When sake is poured into a masu, the scent of cypress becomes part of the experience. To re-create this sensation, I had to source the essence of hinoki, which did not exist. We solved this by creating our own. Unfortunately, you can’t exactly re-create this cocktail as I make it at Katana Kitten without a few drops of a key ingredient, a cypress tree distillate, but I’ve provided a handy workaround to create an approximation. The presentation of the drink is inspired by the traditional sake serve, where a glass is placed in a masu and filled until it overflows into the masu, a sign of expansive generosity. We serve the drink in a custom wooden masu created for us by Cocktail Kingdom. The masu is filled with crushed ice, so the entire surface of the stemless cocktail glass containing the drink has contact with the ice to keep it absolutely cold to the very last sip. To obtain the cypress aroma, I collaborated with Jeff Lindauer, a good friend of mine from Spring44 Distilling in Colorado. We went up into the Rocky Mountains where cypress trees grow in abundance. We identified a varietal that is closest to Japanese cypress, chopped it down, and extracted cypress oil. We first tried a maceration, but it didn’t quite capture the flavor, so we fired up the still and created a 140-proof distillate. The unique and irreplaceable flavor of the tree is captured in the bottle. In this recipe, I provide the closest approximation, which is a homemade hinoki tincture. If you can’t source hinoki wood chips, experiment with other types of wood or omit the tincture completely. You will still have a delightfully dry martini to enjoy.","ingredients":["1¼ ounces Grey Goose vodka","1¼ ounces Spring44 Mountain Gin","½ ounce Lustau “Solera Reserva” fino jarana sherry","¼ ounce Dassai 50 junmai daiginjo sake","5 dashes Hinoki Tincture","Garnish: lemon twist, kombu-brined olive, rakkyo (pickled Japanese scallion bulb), and cypress leaf"],"steps":["Fill a square wooden masu cup with pebble ice and place a chilled stemless martini glass in the ice.

The banks of the Meguro River are lined with thousands of sakura (cherry blossom) trees, and when the blossoms are in season, locals head over to take in the gorgeous views. In this drink, I swap out the traditional gin for genever, since its round and malty flavors work best with the drink’s other ingredients. Instead of vermouth, we use a full-bodied umeshu (plum liqueur) that has a color akin to sweet vermouth and a similar sweetness level, yet tastes completely different and totally transforms the drink. The umeshu’s base is actually Japanese blackstrap rum. Lastly, instead of the traditional Campari, we opt for an aperitivo liqueur made with bitter Calabrian oranges. The final touch is a garnish of fresh kinome leaves.","ingredients":["1 ounce Old Duff Dutch genever","¾ ounce Choya Kokuto umeshu","¾ ounce Caffo Red Bitter","Garnish: lemon twist and fresh kinome leaves"],"steps":["Combine the genever, umeshu, and Caffo Red Bitter in a mixing glass filled with ice.

The rum is produced on the small, remote island of Minamidaito in Okinawa Prefecture. Cor Cor cultivates their own sugarcane on their estate and produces two expressions, one from sugarcane juice in the style of a rhum agricole and one from molasses, which we use in this cocktail. It is a very unique and pungent rum that has a lot of earthy notes you would expect from a Jamaican rum or a Haitian clairin, which we balance with a dry Barbados rum. To complement the lime and yuzu juices, we make a syrup that combines shio koji, a Japanese condiment made of salt, water and rice koji, and pandan leaves.","ingredients":["1½ ounces Mount Gay silver rum","½ ounce Cor Cor Red Okinawan rum","¾ ounce Shio Koji Pandan Syrup","½ ounce fresh lime juice","¼ ounce yuzu juice","Garnish: dehydrated lime wheel"],"steps":["Combine the rums, pandan syrup, lime juice, and yuzu juice in a cocktail shaker with ice.

A bit of blue curaçao keeps things vibrant, along with some bubbles from a dry sparkling wine, and this colorful drink is garnished with a bright red cocktail cherry.

But most of all, it is a celebration of Calpico, the Japanese soft drink. It is actually a perfect modifier, as it brings sweetness that is balanced by a yogurt-like tang. Calpico also works as an emulsifier, like egg whites or cream, that binds all the different flavors and ingredients together and, when topped with soda, creates a delightfully frothy head. Finally, the Calpico lends the cocktail its white appearance, which we counterbalance with black lava salt on the rim, to re-create the colors of a panda’s fur.","ingredients":["Black lava salt, for rimming the glass","Lemon wedge, for rimming the glass","1¼ ounces Suntory Haku vodka","½ ounce pear eau-de-vie","1 ounce Calpico concentrate","½ ounce fresh lemon juice","½ ounce Pandan Syrup","Soda water, chilled"],"steps":["Rim a Collins glass with black lava salt.

Beer and whisky are, of course, a delicious combination, playing off their shared DNA of malted barley. This cocktail, a take on a Chicago Fizz, is my way to salute the season.

Denki Bran is around 25% ABV and the brandy is 50%, so we bring down the latter’s proof with a mix of teas—chamomile, Assam, strawberry, and mint—and add a bit of sugar. The tea and spices all work well together, and the lager has a tea undertone.

They have become ubiquitous in New York City restaurants in recent years as well. These small peppers are concentrated with a bright green flavor and bring a vibrant color that lends the cocktail its name. I moved to New York City in 2008 and noticed a certain trend among restaurants, with particular vegetables gaining huge popularity and seeming to pop up on every menu across town.

The drink is very personal, and this is how I prefer making them at home. In Japan, after a long day’s work, people head to their local bar or izakaya and order beer and whisky highballs. This is a great pairing with the Izakaya’s fried and salty snacks, which beg for a refreshing accompaniment. Moreover, at around $5 a pop, it is completely democratic and popular across all demographics. My version is the Platonic ideal of simplicity and deliciousness. The trick is to keep your Japanese whisky in the freezer and your seltzer in the fridge. While at the bar we obsess about ice, ordinary store-bought bagged ice will do just fine here. If your whisky is room temperature, stir it over the ice to bring it down in temperature. If it is coming from the freezer, as I prefer, stir it to raise the temperature and make the spirit amenable to proper dilution. Then add whatever fizzy water you have on hand, provided it is straight from the fridge. The drink takes literally seconds to throw together and enjoy. It is great as an aperitif, a meal accompaniment, or just for kicking back and watching the game or a movie.

So if you find yourself entertaining a large group of friends or family, this is something you take your time to prepare in advance, but it is well worth the effort. My inspiration was my youth in Japan, when Kahlúa and milk was everyone’s favorite drink. This version is a take on Mary Rockett’s classic clarified milk punch, which has the sophistication, complexity, and finesse of each ingredient through maceration. The recipe was brought to my attention in Dave Wondrich’s definitive book on the flowing bowl, Punch. This perfectly clear punch has a long mixological heritage and was a way to preserve milk by removing the proteins and fat solids that would otherwise spoil. The fact that it has a good alcoholic kick as a further preservative makes it irresistible to cocktail fans. The technique is finding renewed popularity today, as it creates a symphony of flavors that are perfectly melded together. I chose as my base a Highland Scotch whisky with classic Speyside rich malt sweetness and spice from sherry cask aging. Aged rum adds a roundness to the flavor and also brings baking spice aromas, like vanilla and cinnamon, from resting in American oak barrels. The milk emulsifies all the ingredients and smooths out any edges to the alcohol. To create the maximum intensity of coffee flavor, I use dark roasted espresso beans, as well as Kahlúa. Lastly, tamari adds a savory note that complements its sweetness, like sprinkling a bit of salt into hot chocolate.

In keeping with its provenance, I wanted to use exclusively American spirits. To give it a Japanese flair, I call for a fresh yuzu twist. Yuzu is traditionally available in fall and winter, but it is now grown in California. At around $3 for a small fruit, its aromatic zest is incomparable. Kakinoki means “persimmon tree” in Japanese. Back home in Minowa, there is an abundance of these trees behind our family home and on the hillside of the nearby mountains. My grandma used to pick persimmons to prepare hoshi gaki, which consisted of the fruit being peeled, smoked, and dried in long rows outside, creating a picturesque orange curtain.","ingredients":["1¼ ounces Bertoux brandy","1¼ ounces Old Overholt Rye Whiskey Whiskey","½ ounce Apologue Persimmon bittersweet liqueur","1 barspoon date syrup","3 dashes Sangostura Bitters","3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters","Garnish: yuzu twist"],"steps":["Combine the brandy, whiskey, persimmon liqueur, date syrup, and both bitters in a mixing glass with ice.

My mind immediately raced to kurumi, which are Japanese walnuts that lend the cocktail its name. As the leaves turn with the season, the walnuts fall from the trees, and people happily gather them up. I have many fond memories of my grandma sitting beside a big pile of walnuts, carefully cracking them open and harvesting the lovely nut within, which she transformed into a beautiful sauce for mochi (rice cakes). The cocktail itself is my take on the classic Japanese cocktail that was included in Jerry Thomas’s 1862 book How to Mix Drinks, or The Bon-Vivant’s Companion. Ironically, there is nothing specifically Japanese about the Japanese cocktail, except its back story. Cocktail historian and friend of the bar David Wondrich theorizes that the drink was created to celebrate a visit by Japan’s first diplomatic mission to the US following the opening of Japan. The delegation found friendly refuge in Thomas’s bar and was led by Tateishi “Tommy” Onojirou Noriyuki, who earned quite a reputation as a bon vivant. In my version of this simple cocktail, I stay true to the classic with a Cognac base. Walnuts are incorporated into a lovely orgeat syrup and the cocktail’s pleasing nuttiness is further amplified with pecan bitters.","ingredients":["2 ounces Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal Cognac","½ ounce Kurumi Orgeat","3 dashes Miracle Mile toasted pecan bitters","Garnish: lemon twist"],"steps":["Combine the cognac, orgeat, and bitters in a mixing glass with ice.

The best part was that I got to spend time with my good friend Max Warner, Chivas’s global brand ambassador and an all-around awesome guy. When we were judging Japanese regional finals in Tokyo, I was asked to create a drink for the competing bartenders to enjoy. My inspiration came from two New York City bars. The first was Dante, with its take on the Garibaldi, a classic combination of Campari and ultra-fluffy orange juice. The second was the Horse’s Apple at the now departed Suffolk Arms, with the guest’s choice of spirit, freshly pressed Granny Smith apple juice and freshly grated horseradish. My creation marries Chivas 18 with “fluffy” Fuji apple juice. You can only get this texture using a Breville juicer. Like a highball, it is an extremely simple drink, so texture, temperature, and perfect ingredients are paramount. The Chivas is beautiful, with its signature apple and stone fruit notes, with eighteen years describing the youngest whiskies in the blend that also contains much older ones. The fresh Fuji apple juice amplifies the sweetness of the malt and adds refreshing acidity as well. The buckwheat honey syrup gives roundness to the drink.","ingredients":["1¼ ounces Chivas Regal 18","¼ ounce Buckwheat Honey Syrup","Fresh Fuji apple juice","Garnish: freshly grated cinnamon"],"steps":["Combine the whisky and honey syrup in a double old-fashioned glass over an ice sphere and top with apple juice.

But did you know it is also home to a beloved regional dish, miso butter corn ramen? Just like it sounds, it consists of your basic ramen noodles swimming in a miso broth that is enriched with corn kernels and a fat pat of butter that quickly melts and coats the entire surface. It is absolutely delicious, and I wanted to give a sense of it in a cocktail. I use Mellow Corn, a straight corn whiskey from Heaven Hill Distillery. The whiskey is fat-washed with butter to capture the round mouthfeel and give it a nuanced creamy flavor. White miso enters the picture, along with crème fraîche. Finally, I incorporate a corn puree made from rehydrated freeze-dried corn kernels. These have an intense corn flavor and allow for consistent results year-round. Of course, if it’s the height of corn season, feel free to use a roasted sweet puree of fresh corn kernels instead.","ingredients":["2 ounces Salted Butter-Washed Whiskey","¾ ounce Cornsilk Syrup","¾ ounce fresh lemon juice","1 ounce Corn Puree","1 barspoon White Miso-Crème Fraîche","Garnish: corn husk and crystallized soy sauce"],"steps":["Combine the whiskey, syrup, lemon juice, corn puree, and crème fraîche in a cocktail shaker with ice.

Traditionally, the buds, which are ruddy bronze on the outside and white within, are finely cut into slivers and are used as a condiment, adorning miso soup, soba noodles, and other dishes. It has a delicate, ginger-like spiciness.

This cocktail is a fun take on a margarita and takes its cues from a classic Japanese dessert called zunda-mochi. It is comprised of mochi (rice cakes) topped with savory and sweet edamame sauce. Most people are familiar with edamame steamed or boiled with sea salt that is served in restaurants and are surprised that the humble legume is also used in desserts. In zunda, the edamame are cooked with water, mashed, and sweetened to make a sauce. In this cocktail, the edamame forms the base of our silky pale green syrup. As the drink’s foundation, I chose Milk-Washed Tequila, which adds a creamy, round mouthfeel and accounts for the “whey” in the drink’s name. Amazake, a kind of no-alcohol sake, adds a hint of sweetness.","ingredients":["Lime Salt, for rimming the glass","Lime wedge, for rimming the glass","1½ ounce Milk-Washed Tequila","½ ounce amazake (a kind of no-alcohol sake)","¾ ounce Zunda Syrup","¾ ounce fresh lime juice","Garnish: pea shoot"],"steps":["Rim a quarter of a rocks glass with the lime salt.

This is a traditional Mint Julep variation. Peaches grow abundantly in the South, and are celebrated in many local drinks and dishes. Meanwhile, Nagano is famous for its stone fruits, including peaches (momo), plums, ume, and apricots. For this recipe, I use bourbon, a smidgen of peach liqueur, mint, and sugar. To this, I add an oleo-saccharum perfumed by preserved sakura (cherry blossom) leaves. They add a distinct herbaceousness and salinity that go well with the bourbon, and a touch of ginger acts as a bridge between the spirit and the peach flavor. Pro tip: Instead of muddling the mint leaves, rub them on the inside surface of the julep cup to really extract their fragrant essence.","ingredients":["8 to 10 mint leaves","2 ounces bourbon","¼ ounce peach liqueur","½ ounce Sakura Leaf Oleo-Saccharum","1 barspoon Rich Ginger Syrup","Garnish: mint sprig bouquet"],"steps":["Take the mint leaves, rub the inside of a julep cup, and leave them on the bottom.

It has elegant notes of oak and honey, which I thought would be nicely complemented by earthy mushrooms. I chose matsutake, a sought-after seasonal delicacy that grows at the feet of red pine trees and is incredibly fragrant. Many people compare them to porcinis. For this cocktail, I make a syrup that mixes these two exquisite mushrooms.

Bamboo is, of course, very Japanese and, growing up in a valley, the mountains behind our house were surrounded by stalks of wild bamboo.

This classic cocktail is traditionally whisk(e)y-based and in its place, I use charcoal-roasted barley tea, as malted barley is often part of a spirit’s mash bill.

Hoppy is seeing a revival today in Japan, as some believe it is healthier than regular beer, since it contains no purines, and shochu is considered a very clean distillate. While I won’t venture a medical opinion, I’m a fan of Hoppy for its nostalgic taste. This is a nonalcoholic shandy with Hopped Yuzu Sherbet. Quaffable and sessionable, it showcases Cascade hops’ refreshing nose, which pairs well with the uniquely zesty yuzu citrus.","ingredients":["¾ ounce Hopped Yuzu Sherbet","1½ ounces water, chilled","Hoppy (or substitute any nonalcoholic beer), for topping","Garnish: yuzu wheel"],"steps":["Fill a collins glass with ice.

In his drink, sesame-infused Japanese whisky takes the place of rye, with ginger liqueur and Marsala wine replacing maraschino liqueur and Punt e Mes. Its feline name is rooted in history and politics, of which Erick is a keen student. He’s long been fascinated with samurai, Japan’s feudal military caste that was governed by Bushido (the Way of the Warrior), a code that prized honor and loyalty, and dictated nearly all areas of a samurai’s life. During times of political intrigue or upheaval, it would sometimes be necessary to engage in clandestine techniques and tactics, such as spying, espionage, and assassinations. However, this behavior was seen as contravening Bushido. A practical workaround was that the katana-wielding samurai would use ninjas (mercenary martial artists and saboteurs) as their proxies to do their bidding. Since ninjas were typically of a lower caste than samurai and not held to the standards of Bushido, these “dishonorable” tactics could be employed without fear of shame.

Its creator, Gates Otsuji, is the founder of Controlled Substances, a cocktail and beverage consultancy, and this martini variation exudes a wealth of subtle, delicately nuanced flavors. Gates’s inspiration was his Japanese grandmother’s goma (sesame) pickles, which were present at every family gathering. Here they are incorporated both in the glass and as a garnish. In this cocktail, he calls for “Mirror of Truth,” a lovely sake that dances gently across the palate, with a subtle grassy note to complement the fragrant botanicals of Beefeater 24 London Dry gin, especially Japanese sencha. The kombu, added to the pickling brine, provides enough umami to give heft to the cocktail and round out the edges on the palate.","ingredients":["2 Fresno chile slices","1 drop sriracha (optional)","2 ounces Beefeater 24 London Dry gin","1 ounce Masumi Okuden Kantsukuri “Mirror of Truth” junmai sake","½ ounce Dolin dry vermouth (or substitute Noilly Prat vermouth)","½ ounce Goma Pickle Brine","1 dash bergamot citrus puree (preferably Boiron)","Garnish: slice of Goma Pickle"],"steps":["Gently crush the Fresno chile slices in a mixing glass and add a drop of sriracha, if desired.

She devoured fresh lychees all the time and wanted to use them in a cocktail. Julie created this libation, as well as a zero-proof version of the drink (without the gin) and named it after her daughter, whose middle name is Leilani, Hawaiian for “heavenly flower.” Her little girl adores the taste of lychees and really enjoys the nonalcoholic version of this drink.","ingredients":["2 lychee nuts, peeled and pitted","2 ounces Ki No Bi Kyoto dry gin (or substitute Tanqueray, Fords, or Plymouth gin)","½ ounce fresh lime juice","¾ ounce Lemongrass Syrup","½ ounce lychee juice","Soda water, chilled","Garnish: lemongrass stalk and lime wheel"],"steps":["Muddle the lychee fruit in a cocktail shaker.

Antonio’s inspiration harkens back to the historic Battle of Yamazaki, waged in 1582 in present-day Kyoto. The letter in question was from Akechi Mitsuhide, a renegade samurai who had killed his own warlord, Oda Nobunaga, and usurped his power. Compounding this ultimate betrayal, the letter was an appeal to a rival clan to help Mitsuhide consolidate his ill-gotten gains. Forces loyal to the rightful heir, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, intercepted the letter and subsequently defeated the rogue samurai. Hideyoshi went on to become one of Japan’s great unifiers. Antonio’s choice of Yamazaki whisky pays tribute to this battle, with strawberry and pomegranate adding seasonal acidity. It celebrates the triumph of honor and fealty over arrogance and greed.","ingredients":["1½ ounces Strawberry and Pomegranate-Infused Japanese Whisky","⅓ ounce sake-based yuzu liqueur","¼ ounce fresh lime juice","1 barspoon grenadine","Garnish: Japanese momiji (maple) leaf"],"steps":["Combine the whisky, yuzu liqueur, lime juice, and grenadine in a cocktail shaker with ice.

Hisashi Watanabe, bartender and owner of Bar Gyu+ in Hokkaido, Japan, still wanted to use his country’s renowned whisky in cocktails, but its prospects were looking grim. Undeterred, Hisashi sent his team out to buy up all the affordable whiskies and proceeded to create a house blend of three whiskies from Nikka—Taketsuru Pure Malt, Black Deep Blend, and Black Rich Blend—that wouldn’t break the bank. Taketsuru Pure Malt is a no-age statement blended malt whisky (said to be ten years old) named after Nikka’s founder, and is the company’s respected entry-level pour. The blend contains whiskies from their Miyagikyo and Yoichi distilleries, including sherry cask-finished malts, which impart richness.

If you want to practice the hard shake, this is the drink for it, and you will be rewarded with an exceptional mouthfeel. Mr. Ueno recently revealed to me how the White Lady became his signature cocktail. He had been working at Star Bar, another revered Ginza destination, and a guest asked for a White Lady, a very reasonable request. The problem was, all the bar’s shakers were being used, and the only one left was an oversize shaker designed for cocktail competitions that could make up to five drinks at a time. The guest was very impressed, not only by the cocktail, but by the shaker, and when the guest inquired why Mr. Ueno used such a large shaker, to save face, Ueno told him that only a large shaker could create the tiny bubbles he was seeking. The guest not only believed this white lie, but apparently related it to everyone he knew. Suddenly, guests were coming in and demanding a White Lady made in a “big shaker.” This story has followed Mr. Ueno around the world, and he apologizes for his harmless indiscretion.

As good as his word, he has devoted his labors to rescuing déclassé drinks like the Grasshopper, Blue Hawaii, and Long Island Iced Tea. But his most successful salvage job has been the Amaretto Sour. “I always liked Amaretto Sours,” he said. “I drank them in college sometimes. Then, when everyone started getting super serious about drinks, it just kinda got left by the wayside. I remember seeing other bartenders talk about the ‘dark days’ of cocktails, and they’d always mention the Amaretto Sour as an example of how terrible the drinks were back in the day.” So, around 2009, he went about improving it. His chief innovation—and the one that took the drink from tacky to terrific—was the addition of nearly an ounce of quality overproof bourbon. He put the recipe on his popular blog around 2012. By 2014, he bravely put it on the menu at Clyde Common. But it was at Pépé le Moko, a kitschy subterranean bar that opened beneath Clyde Common in 2014, that the cocktail became a star. “It was probably our number one seller along with the Grasshopper,” he recalled. “People seemed kinda relieved that they could go to a fancy cocktail bar and have fun drinks for once.” The drink has since become the default recipe for the Amaretto Sour at craft cocktail bars around the world.","ingredients":["1½ ounces amaretto","¾ ounce bourbon, preferably Booker’s","1 ounce lemon juice","1 teaspoon simple syrup (2:1)","½ ounce egg white, beaten","Lemon twist for garnish","Brandied cherry for garnish"],"steps":["Dry shake all the ingredients except the garnishes—that is, shake them up without ice—in a cocktail shaker.

In the 1990s, when Berry began his journey of discovery, the tiki world of Los Angeles was a diaspora of bartenders who held, but would not share, the recipes to the bygone cocktail glories of Trader Vic and his tiki archrival, Donn Beach of Don the Beachcomber. Published recipes were all but nonexistent, as tiki bartending had always been a proprietary, secretive art. (The super-unhelpful recipe for the Navy Grog published in a sales pamphlet called only for “Trader Vic Navy Grog Rum” and “Trader Vic Navy Grog Mix”—two extinct products.) Berry resorted to guesswork and reverse-engineering to create his version of the drink. A crucial key to unlocking the recipe came when fellow L.A. cocktail nerd Ted Haigh uncovered a stash of bottles of the discontinued Wray & Nephew Pimento Dram at a liquor store in Costa Mesa called Hi-Time Wine Cellars. Tasting it for the first time was an “aha!” moment  for Berry; pimento (aka Jamaican allspice) was the secret flavoring used in Vic’s Navy Grog mix. Two veteran tiki bartenders, Tony Ramos at Madame Wu’s and Mike Buhen at the Tiki-Ti, confirmed Berry’s hunch. Further tinkering got Berry to the recipe offered here, which is not strictly a Trader Vic Navy Grog, but his interpretation of it. Stripped away were honey and the white rum. The entire process took years. “I called it the Ancient Mariner partly because by the time I finished with it, that’s how old I felt,” Berry said. The drink first appeared in 1994 in Berry’s DIY version of the Grog Log, a xeroxed, folded, and stapled zine-like recipe collection that he gave away for free. The Log was given a proper publication in 1998. A decade later, the drink made its first appearance on a cocktail menu at Rivera in downtown L. A. It has since also been sold at bars in New York, Boston, New Orleans, Athens, and Melbourne, and published in volumes like the Mr. Boston bartending guide. It even has its own Wikipedia page.","ingredients":["1 ounce Demerara rum, preferably El Dorado 8-year or Hamilton 86 Demerara River rum","1 ounce dark Jamaican rum, preferably Coruba Original Blend rum, Appleton Estate Rare Blend 12-Year, or Myers’s Original Dark rum","¾ ounce lime juice","½ ounce white grapefruit juice","½ ounce simple syrup","¼ ounce pimento dram","Mint sprig for garnish","Lime wedge for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnishes in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

One night, Davidson fielded a “bartender’s choice” order (that is, a drink bartenders serve to patrons who give them free rein) from a customer asking for rum and bitters. He whipped together a mix of white rum and Cynar, gave the glass a green Chartreuse rinse and a mint-leaf garnish, and sent it out. When he was later called on to create an amaro drink for the menu, Davidson refined the drink, increasing the percentage of Cynar and Chartreuse, relegating the rum to spiritous scaffolding, and upping the mint’s role through muddling. Most audaciously, he added lime juice but kept the cocktail a stirred drink. (Drinks with juice are typically shaken.) The Art of Choke was a local industry secret for a while. But Davidson took the drink to every bar he worked at, including the popular Chicago restaurant the Publican, where it was batched and offered to diners as a shot called “Kyle’s After Pork” digestif. With that, and its inclusion in the influential 2009 book Rogue Cocktails as well as its sequel Beta Cocktails, news of the drink got around to the right people—that is, other bartenders.

This bacon fat–washed version of the classic was a sensation from the day it was put on the menu at the East Village speakeasy in 2007. Bartender Don Lee created it using Benton’s bacon fat, borrowed from chef David Chang’s nearby restaurant Momofuku. “Looking at American whiskey and the other food traditions of that area, smoked meats [were] a part of that,” said Lee. “The first spirit I tried to make the Benton’s Old-Fashioned with was George Dickel whiskey, because Benton’s comes from Tennessee, so I wanted to use a Tennessee whiskey.” At that time, it was impossible to get hold of Dickel, so Lee ended up switching to the Four Roses Yellow Label bourbon. Lee didn’t invent the fat-washing technique for cocktails; other bartenders, like Eben Freeman, had experimented with it before him. But the Benton’s Old-Fashioned popularized the approach. PDT took the drink off the menu soon after its initial appearance. That didn’t go over well. “In the weeks and months after we took the Benton’s Old-Fashioned off the menu, many guests who had either tried it when we served it, read about it, or heard about it from a friend, requested it,” recalled Jim Meehan, who ran the bar at the time. “It became tiresome and counterintuitive not to bring it back.” Benton’s has been PDT’s best-selling drink ever since; the bar sells roughly 150 a week, according to owner Jeff Bell. It’s also, incidentally, the top seller at PDT Hong Kong. “If you had to pick one drink that defines PDT’s approach and legacy under my watch, I’d say it would be the Benton’s Old-Fashioned,” says Meehan.","ingredients":["2 ounces Benton’s Bacon Fat-Washed Four Roses Bourbon","¼ ounce Grade B maple syrup","2 dashes Angostura bitters","Orange twist for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a rocks glass filled with one large cube of ice.

But no modern bar outside of the inimitable Milk & Honey and Pegu Club is better represented in this book. The Paper Plane, Eeyore’s Requiem, Art of Choke, and Juliet & Romeo were all born there, as was this drink by Stephen Cole. Cole created the drink on the spot in spring 2007 for Giuseppe Tentori, a chef he knew who wasn’t much of a cocktail drinker. “Seeing how he was from Italy and preferred cocktails that were lower ABV, I thought that a Cynar-based cocktail was a good direction to start,” said Cole. He began by building a Manhattan with a base of Cynar, the Italian artichoke-flavored liqueur. But, realizing that was “a horrible idea,” he introduced a bit of acid through lemon juice and lemon oils to lift the drink up a bit and cut through the mixture’s sweetness. He finished it off with a couple dashes of orange bitters. The drink was slowly adopted by other bartenders who hung out at The Violet Hour. They then brought the drink back to where they worked. After a while, Cole began to see it on menus from coast to coast and even heard of appearances in France, Spain, England, and Italy. “I think one of the keys to this cocktail is how minimal it is yet has tons of layers,” he said. “Starts heavy but finishes clean.”","ingredients":["2 ounces Cynar","¾ ounce Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth","2 dashes Regans’ orange bitters","Lemon peel, with a little pulp left on it","Lemon slice for garnish"],"steps":["Combine the liquid ingredients in a rocks glass filled with ice.

So this cocktail was a revelation to drinkers on three levels. Smith brought the drink with him when he opened the influential speakeasy Bourbon & Branch, thus boosting the cocktail’s profile. (Several of the cocktails Bourbon & Branch became famous for, including the Revolver, were actually invented elsewhere.) But it wasn’t until the late 2010s that the Black Manhattan attained ubiquity.

He could not wait to flee to London, where he began what became the most celebrated bartending career in modern English history. But he did remember the fragrant blackberry patches that grew on the island. While working at the private bar Fred’s Club in the early 1990s, he sampled a new crème de mure, and the taste of those wild berries came flooding back to him. He used the liqueur to adorn a simple gin sour served on crushed ice, showing the crème de mure off properly by drizzling a half ounce of it over the top of the drink. In case people missed the point, he garnished the cocktail with a big fat blackberry. The drink made its premiere at Fred’s Club, but it gained wide release when Jonathan Downey put it on the menu at his popular London bar Match, where you didn’t need a membership to get in.","ingredients":["2 ounces gin","¾ ounce lemon juice","½ ounce simple syrup","½ ounce crème de mure","Blackberry for garnish","Lemon slice for garnish"],"steps":["Combine the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

One morning in 1996, Calabrese’s wife, Susan, was enjoying her customary marmalade on toast. Impatient with her restless husband, who would not pause for breakfast, she insisted he sit down and have a slice himself. “The bitter, tangy flavor of the orange marmalade played with my taste buds,” recalled Calabrese, a native of Italy and by then already a veteran of the London bartending scene. At the time, he was working at the Library Bar in the Lanesborough, a luxury hotel in the city’s upscale Belgravia neighborhood, just a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace. “After trying it on the toast, I took the marmalade to work with me to experiment with.” He paired a barspoon of the bittersweet jam with 1⅔ ounces of gin, in keeping with the English culinary theme. To this, he added ½ ounce each of Cointreau and lemon juice to lend the drink its sweet and fresh components, respectively. In a playful nod to the marmalade, he called the sour the Breakfast Martini. It didn’t take long for the drink to attract notice. “It was so unique and unusual that it sparked the customer’s interest” almost immediately, he said. “So much so that people were asking for it as soon as we opened the bar at 11 a.m.” The Breakfast Martini, it seems, was indeed a breakfast Martini from the get-go.","ingredients":["1⅔ ounces gin","½ ounce curaçao","½ ounce lemon juice","1 barspoon English orange marmalade","Orange twist for garnish"],"steps":["Combine the gin and marmalade in a cocktail shaker.

In 1996, however, offering a modern interpretation of a nearly forgotten drink like the Sidecar was as unusual as encountering the Sidecar itself. But that’s just what bartender Tony Abou-Ganim did when he dreamed up the Cable Car, which would go on to become a signature for both its creator and the place where it was born, as well as the only modern classic to showcase spiced rum. “Back in 1996 it was still rather unique to create 'original' or 'specialty' cocktails and feature them on a menu,” recalled Abou-Ganim, who worked as the head bartender at the 1920s-inspired Starlight Room when the opulent lounge was relaunched atop San Francisco’s Sir Francis Drake Hotel that same year. The seed that became the Cable Car was planted when representatives from the spiced rum brand Captain Morgan approached Abou-Ganim about developing a new drink featuring their product. A fan of the Sidecar, Abou-Ganim thought he might be able to breathe new life into the neglected classic by swapping out the base spirit of Cognac. The only other change he made was to add cinnamon to the traditional sugar rim. But those two alterations made all the difference. The cocktail was put on the Starlight Room’s second menu, and quickly became a hit. “The pairing of cinnamon sugar with a spiced rum was a simple, yet brilliant, move,” said bartender Marco Dionysos, who had moved to San Francisco around that time. A few years later, in 2002, Dionysos himself was working at the Starlight. The popularity of the Cable Car had not fallen off in the least. By then, Abou-Ganim had moved to Las Vegas. In 1998, he was tapped to operate the many bars at the sprawling Bellagio Hotel and Casino. A year-round hive of visitors, the Bellagio was an ideal forum to bring the Cable Car to a wider audience.","ingredients":["1½ ounces Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum","1 ounce lemon juice","¾ ounce curaçao","½ ounce simple syrup","1 teaspoon cinnamon","1 teaspoon sugar","1 small lemon slice","Orange twist for garnish"],"steps":["In a small shallow bowl, mix the cinnamon and sugar.

She continued to tweak the drink and brought it over to Eastern Standard’s sister bar, The Hawthorne. There she was introduced to 1840 Pierre Ferrand Cognac, and that became the new base.

Those were the two prevailing “bartender’s handshakes”—under-the-radar spirits enjoyed by mixologists who prided themselves on their connoisseurship. Marcovaldo Dionysos was a Chartreuse soldier—so much so that for five years running he entered a San Francisco cocktail competition sponsored by the French herbal liqueur. Over the first four contests, he won once and placed second or third the other times. Having achieved this respectable record as a Chartreuse master, he was prepared to sit out the fifth competition in 2002. But the event organizer reached out and asked him to reconsider. Dionysos’s entry was the Chartreuse Swizzle, an improbable drink that dragged the centuries-old European liqueur into the realm of tiki. He paired it with pineapple juice, lime juice, mint, a load of ice, and one other secret ingredient that all but stole the show from the bright green elixir. Dionysos remembered reading about Velvet falernum, a spiced syrup from the Caribbean, and was intrigued. Once a popular cocktail ingredient, it had been all but forgotten by the twenty-first century until Dale DeGroff created a few cocktails with the syrup and promoted it as well. Between the falernum and the drink’s exotic form—swizzles, icy concoctions typically made with rum and associated with the Caribbean, were not well known in the States at the time—Dionysos caught the judges’ fancy. He took home the prize—a Fuji mountain bike, as he remembered. Thereafter commenced the Chartreuse Swizzle’s incremental, decade-long climb to worldwide recognition. The Swizzle made its first menu appearance at Harry Denton’s Starlight Room, a swank drinkery where Dionysos was working. Denton, a renowned lover of Chartreuse who was known to pour shots of the stuff for guests, was a receptive audience. The cocktail sold decently but was hardly setting the room on fire. It was at the Clock Bar that the cocktail took off. The boîte was opened by celebrity chef Michael Mina in 2008. Clock Bar got plenty of press attention, and the Chartreuse Swizzle was on the opening menu. The cocktail also appeared at Bourbon & Branch, which, upon opening in 2006, instantly became the most famous craft cocktail bar in the city. “Marco’s cocktail seemed to pop up on the most random cocktail menus in town,” recalled cocktail writer Camper English, “and to this day, any time someone combines Chartreuse and pineapple juice, nerds are obligated to scream, 'So it’s basically a Chartreuse Swizzle without the falernum?'” Beginning around 2010, the drink grew international legs. Dionysos partly credits the complex base spirit for the cocktail’s enduring popularity. “Chartreuse is magical stuff,” he said. “I think this drink tastes enough of Chartreuse to satisfy die-hard fans of the spirit but softens it enough to attract newbies.” The drink is also easy to put together. It has only four ingredients, and, now that falernum is a more common commodity, none of them are hard to find. Still, while the drink may be simple to make, it never tastes like a simple drink.","ingredients":["1½ ounces green Chartreuse","1 ounce pineapple juice","¾ ounce lime juice","½ ounce Velvet falernum","Mint sprig for garnish","Freshly grated nutmeg for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnishes in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

Or a B-52? Of course, any shooter that came of age during the cocktail renaissance is going to be less louche. Tonia Guffey’s CIA is made up of Cynar, the heritage artichoke liquor from Italy, and Laird’s bonded apple brandy—two products with unassailable pedigrees. Guffey, a bartender at Dram in Brooklyn and Flatiron Lounge in Manhattan in the early 2010s, was inspired to concoct the potion by a very mixological motivation: she was drinking too much Fernet Branca and needed a change. “I wanted to switch from Fernet to shots of Cynar, but to be honest, it didn’t pack the punch I wanted. I adored Laird’s bonded and the proof was there, so one night I decided to cut the Cynar with Laird’s to give it some oomph. It was pretty fucking delicious.” The idea of inventing a shooter was not anathema to her. “Back in my early club bar days I probably poured and drank a thousand Red-Headed Slut shots [Jägermeister, peach schnapps, and cranberry juice],” she said, “so maybe some underlying inspiration was there.” She eventually tweaked it by adding a dash of Angostura bitters. Still, one doesn’t put shooters on menus at cocktail bars, no matter how delicious. So this one built an underground reputation as a “bartender’s handshake,” something Guffey would pour for fellow barkeeps as they congregated at Dram after their shifts ended at other bars. “It was cheap, easy, and packed a wallop, so it was perfect,” said Guffey. (Guffey called it the Dram shot or sometimes Triple A for amaro, Ango, and applejack. The CIA name—“Cynar In Applejack”—was bestowed by bartender Sother Teague of Amor y Amargo.) Word of the shot spread farther when Guffey and her fellow Dram bartenders would order the drink at bars in New Orleans and Boston and Philadelphia. Most bars they visited had all three ingredients, so it was an easy call. Guffey knew it had achieved a certain fame when she visited a San Diego bar one day and the bartender poured her a CIA, asking if she had ever heard of it. “No one believes me when I say I created it,” said Guffey.","ingredients":["½ ounce Cynar","½ ounce Laird’s bonded apple brandy","1 dash Angostura bitters"],"steps":["Build the ingredients in a shot glass and serve."],"tags":["shot"]},{"name":"Corpse Reviver No. Blue","author":"Jacob Briars","year":2007,"notes":"Can a joke cocktail be a classic? Is Tom Collins running around town badmouthing you? Did Harvey Wallbanger run for president? In other words: Yes, it can. In 2006, Jacob Briars, a bartender from New Zealand, was organizing a cocktail competition in Queenstown. During the run-up, one of the competing bartenders, obsessed with the pre-Prohibition drink Corpse Reviver No. 2, kept ordering it around town. At the same time, a spirits order for the contest went awry and Briars ended up with two cases of blue curaçao. This put Briars in mind of the Facebook rantings of high-strung mixologists who called themselves “Jihad on Blue Drinks.” Cocktail bartenders weren’t known for their sense of humor back then. Briars, feeling that that balloon of hot air needed some puncturing, took some of the extra blue curaçao and, on the final evening of the competition, whipped up a Corpse Reviver No. Blue—basically the same drink, but of a different color. Briars’s witty jibe struck the right note at the time. “People didn’t like blue drinks, or at least thought they shouldn’t like blue drinks,” he recalled. It also helps that the cocktail, while looking like a disco drink, tasted like something from the golden age. Sebastian Reaburn, at 1806 bar in Melbourne, was the first person to serve Briars his own drink. Soon it was all over New Zealand and Australia. A year later, Briars was being tagged on Facebook whenever the cocktail was served in a bar. The free-flowing exchange of bartending talent between Australia and the UK quickly brought the drink to London, where it was served at no-less-lauded a place than Milk & Honey. Briars correctly points out that the drink accomplished nothing new in terms of flavor or structure. Its role was more behavioral. It reminded bartenders that they could be serious about their craft and have a little fun at the same time.","ingredients":["1 ounce gin","1 ounce Lillet Blanc","1 ounce blue curaçao","1 ounce lemon juice","1 dash absinthe","Lemon twist for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

The Cosmo was invented way back in 1988. But despite being rather long in the tooth, it counts as a modern classic for two reasons: it is easily the most famous cocktail to have come along in what can generously be termed recent times, and it’s the cocktail that helped the concept of the cocktail remain relevant at a time when most people didn’t care whether the Great American Mixed Drink lived or died. Bartender Toby Cecchini invented this simple sour as a shift drink for the staff at Odeon, which then was about the hottest chop house in town thanks to the literary Brat Pack. The arrival of Absolut Citron (flavored vodka was not as played out then as it is now) and news of a worse drink with the same name circulating in San Francisco circles served as his initial inspiration. The drink took off rather quickly. Being featured by Dale DeGroff at the Rainbow Room helped. Being chosen as the whistle-wetter of choice of the quartet of would-be Holly Golightlys at the center of Sex and the City helped even more. When highbrow mixology came into vogue, the Cosmo was rejected as a relic of the bad old days. But in time, young bartenders got off their high horse and heeded Marshall Field’s timeless advice to give the people what they want. As often happens when a drink is wildly successful, a good number of claim jumpers said they had invented the Cosmo. As a result, most accounts of the Cosmo’s history refer to a “controversy” over the drink’s origins. This “both sides” school of cocktail historicism serves the public no better than the same approach does political journalism. Cecchini currently owns Long Island Bar in Brooklyn.

When the cocktail first appeared on the menu at the Black Pearl bar in Melbourne, in 2010, no ingredients were listed. If you asked what was in the drink, the bartender would not tell you. The only thing giving the customer a hint as to what they were getting into was the line “You don’t wanna meet this cocktail in a dark alley.” Of course, plenty of people took the bait, and many ended up liking the cocktail. That probably wouldn’t have happened if the Black Pearl had advertised the ingredients: tequila, Yellow Chartreuse, Jägermeister, and a whole egg. Taken together, the mélange was downright intimidating. “You know how it is,” said Chris Hysted-Adams, explaining how he came to create the Death Flip. “You’re a young, impressionable bartender, so all you like drinking is tequila, Jägermeister, and Chartreuse. Chances are, during service, you’re recommending cocktails to your guests with tequila, Jägermeister, or Chartreuse in them.” The problem is, customers don’t like such pet bar-world spirits as much as bartenders do. Frustrated by his clientele’s timidity, Hysted-Adams doubled down on his preferences and created a drink that included all three spirits. It didn’t take long for it to develop a cult following. “They’d have a sip, and the look on their face was priceless,” recalled Hysted-Adams. “They couldn’t believe that car crash of ingredients tasted so good.” Shortly after, he had bartender acquaintances emailing him, asking for permission to feature it on their cocktail lists. As for the impression-making name, the drink is indeed a flip—that is, the nineteenth-century genre of cocktail that calls for an egg. But there is a second meaning. “I’m a skateboarding tragic, and the death flip is a bad-ass trick,” said Hysted. “A drink this bad-ass needed a bad-ass name to go with it.”","ingredients":["1 ounce blanco tequila","½ ounce Yellow Chartreuse","½ ounce Jägermeister","1 dash simple syrup","1 whole egg","Freshly grated nutmeg for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

The drink is a fairly simple twist on the Last Word, a lost pre-Prohibition cocktail that inspired many young bartenders in the aughts. Ward replaced the gin in the Last Word with mezcal. And instead of Chartreuse, he reached for Aperol, an easygoing Italian bitters that was then winning friends left and right. The drink was an early favorite with Mayahuel guests and one of the bar’s best sellers. The recipe has since appeared in nearly every published book about agave spirits. Ward named the drink after a Pink Floyd album he listened to a lot while staining the wooden surfaces of the bar prior to Mayahuel’s opening.

That was appropriate, since the cocktail was intended as an homage to the hotel’s legendary tea service. “Tea is often served with lemon, lumps of sugar on the side, and milk,” explained Saunders. “Instead of using milk, I opted for the egg white, which not only provides an ethereal mouthfeel but is also a perfect foil for the tea’s tannins. Technically the egg white bonds to the tannins in the tea before it has an opportunity to cause palate fatigue, similar to what you might experience with red wine. The half-sugar rim is a nod to the lumps of sugar traditionally served with tea.” The drink made its American debut at the Bemelmans Bar in the Carlyle, where Saunders worked at the time.

Together they comprise two ounces of booze and pointedly shift the lesser amounts of gin and blanc vermouth to the backseat. “We had been really pushing the envelope on what makes a Negroni,” said Maloney. “Even our house Negroni was two ounces gin, one ounce sweet vermouth, a half ounce Campari, and three dashes orange bitters. So this was looking to completely turn that on its head and make it a Campari-based cocktail while stacking complexity and bitterness to the nth degree.” Predictably, chefs and bartenders cottoned to it. As that magazine item pointed out, it was “one for the geeks.” But eventually, as Negroni riffs and amari began to rise in popularity, it gathered a wider audience.

The result of those two passions was the Ellison, a 2006 spin on the Southside cocktail that threw in muddled cucumber to echo the cucumber flavors in the gin. (Hendrick’s can be credited with the flurry of cocktails created in the aughts that called for cucumber, an ingredient that previously not had much play in mixology outside of the Pimm's No. 1 Cup.) “It was immediately a hit with everyone,” recalled Hardwick. “I’ve never served a drink with broader appeal—women, men, older, millennials, bartenders, and everyday guests all loved it.” Hardwick went on to work at some of New York’s best bars, including the Grill and the Office.

But that didn’t stop customers from asking head bartender Dale DeGroff to make them custom concoctions. And once one patron got an off-menu treat, others got wind of it and wanted one as well. One night in 1995, a jaded gin-and-tonic drinker asked DeGroff for something with a bit more pizzazz. DeGroff fixed up a basic gin sour—gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup—and topped it with a few shakes of Angostura bitters. He then shook it up and served it on the rocks with a lemon wheel garnish. The guy ordered several of them. Soon people were asking for “the gin thing.” The cocktail became the sensation of the summer of 1995, and DeGroff finally decided to put it on the menu. There was already a Hemingway Daiquiri on the list. A bar regular who was a writer at the New Yorker thought it only fair that the new drink be named after Hemingway’s contemporary and literary rival, F. Scott. Thus, the Fitzgerald was born. (Having both novelists on the menu gave bartenders a good lead-in to a story with customers, said DeGroff.) The media soon picked up on the new drink, and when DeGroff included it in his 2002 book, The Craft of the Cocktail, all the world was in on the secret. It continues to be popular at bars around the world. But if you really want to find the cocktail’s home, visit St. Paul, Fitzgerald’s hometown, and its sister city, Minneapolis.

In 2006, few people in the United States saw the appeal of gin or pastis. Saunders’s rather counterintuitive solution to this problem was to put both gin and pastis in the same shaken drink—along with lime juice, simple syrup, and mint leaves. The name references both the popularity of pastis in late 1800s France and the opalescent quality created when the pastis louched in the glass, an effect Saunders considered the drink’s “garnish.” The French Pearl debuted on the Pegu menu in spring 2006. It was yet another in a line of Saunders’s Mojito explorations, which previously included the Gin-Gin Mule (this page) and the Old Cuban (this page). The French Pearl took a bit longer to take off, as Saunders was busy running a bar and had no time for travel to promote the drink internationally.

He ordered the Whiskey Smash—a mix of bourbon, simple syrup, lemon juice, and muddled mint created by Dale DeGroff. The drink immediately lodged in his mind. Back in Germany the next year, at an industry workshop, Meyer was paging through a recipe booklet provided by a brand rep for G’Vine, the French gin. An unusual basil garnish featured in the book caught his attention. That same evening, as was his habit, Meyer preceded his nightly shift with an espresso at the nearby Café Paris. There he often chatted with the chefs and borrowed ingredients to experiment with at Le Lion. Thinking of the mint in DeGroff’s Whiskey Smash, as well as the garnish in the G’Vine manual, he grabbed a bunch of fresh basil that night. He tried it first with bourbon, using the Smash formula. Not delicious. Then he tried gin, and voilà! Over the next few years—through a combination of the drink’s natural appeal, a post on Meyer’s well-read cocktail blog The Bitters Blog, and Meyer’s innate talent for self-promotion—the drink became a hit in Germany. Soon after, it jumped the border and was served in other countries. In 2012, Meyer painted the words “Cradle of the Gin Basil Smash” on the outside of his bar. Meyer sells 300 to 500 Gin Basil Smashes at Le Lion every week, 22,000 annually, and the bar goes through more than 3,100 bottles of gin every year. The drink is so ubiquitous that a bartender once called it “Meyer’s curse.” Bartenders hate muddling.","ingredients":["2 ounces gin","1 ounce lemon juice","¾ ounce simple syrup","2 sprigs of basil leaves"],"steps":["Muddle one sprig of basil leaves at the bottom of a cocktail shaker.

The former emerged as the Slope (this page), the latter as the Gin Blossom. The key ingredient distinguishing both was a single flavor: apricot. Eric Seed, of the Minnesota-based importer Haus Alpenz, had just introduced Reiner to his new-to-market apricot eau de vie and apricot liqueur. Reiner thought that they were both excellent and might work in riffs on classics. She tinkered with the Gin Blossom at Flatiron Lounge, her Manhattan cocktail bar. Reiner ran through countless permutations of gin, vermouth, and bitters for a test audience of friends and colleagues. The final recipe harkened back to early mixological history, which had a long tradition of adding trace amounts of an ingredient or two to the classic combination of gin and vermouth. The Gin Blossom was an immediate hit with guests. Among its early fans was one person very close to the drink’s creator: Susan Fedroff, co-owner of Clover Club and Reiner’s wife. Fedroff wasn’t expecting to be won over. “I was never much of a gin drinker; I like whiskey,” Fedroff said. “But it is legitimately one of my favorite drinks of all time.” She wasn’t alone. During those early days, Fedroff was in the habit of checking the Clover Club sales report at the end of the day. “It was all about the Gin Blossoms and deviled eggs,” she remembers.","ingredients":["1½ ounces Plymouth gin","1½ ounces Martini bianco vermouth","¾ ounce apricot eau de vie","2 dashes orange bitters","Orange twist for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a mixing glass half-filled with ice and stir until chilled, about 15 seconds.

It is essentially a Mojito (a rum drink) crossed with a Moscow Mule (a vodka drink), but made with gin. It also illustrates the wide influence the omnipresent Mojito had on bartenders at the turn of the twenty-first century. “Dale [DeGroff] showed me his recipe for a classic Mojito with a dash or two of Angostura,” said Saunders. “Having a cocktail that had a fresh herb in it—who knew? Wow, that’s amazing. For me, the Mojito base, mint and lime, was really, really enjoyable. At that point, I dove head first into gin. So, sub out the rum and try the gin and see how that tastes.” Saunders found a recipe for homemade ginger beer from a kitchen staff member at Beacon, the midtown Manhattan restaurant where she managed the bar. “It had a lot more sugar in it, so I tightened it up,” said Saunders, who reasoned that she was already adding simple syrup in cocktails anyway. The drink debuted at Beacon in 2000. It later became a mainstay at Pegu Club, Saunders’ lower Manhattan cocktail bar. (Saunders believes that the key to this drink is the homemade ginger beer, since store-bought ginger beer has a more peppery than gingery profile and is many times more sweet. So making the ginger beer is worth your while. If you absolutely must use commercial ginger beer, reduce the simple syrup in the drink to ½ ounce or less.)","ingredients":["1¾ ounces Tanqueray London Dry gin","1 ounce simple syrup","1 ounce Homemade Ginger Beer","¾ ounce lime juice","2 mint sprigs","Lime wheel for garnish","Candied ginger for garnish"],"steps":["Combine the simple syrup, lime juice, and one mint sprig at the bottom of a cocktail glass.

Siegal","year":2000,"notes":"The Gold Rush, invented by T. J. Siegal, was the first breakout original cocktail at Milk & Honey, the holy of holies of modern cocktail bars. Siegal’s achievement is all the more remarkable when you consider that he’s not really a bartender. In fact, he came up with the idea for the Gold Rush not while standing behind the bar at Milk & Honey, but while sitting at it, sometime in 2000. “I had finished a long shift at work in midtown,” told Siegal, “and I sat down for a bourbon sour as I had many nights previous—on the rocks, without egg or garnish.” Milk & Honey founder Sasha Petraske, who also happened to be Siegal’s childhood friend, told him about a honey syrup he had put together to make an old drink called the Honeysuckle Cocktail (basically a Daiquiri made with honey). Siegal asked him to make his Bourbon Sour with that honey syrup instead of simple syrup. The bourbon used was Knob Creek; later, Elijah Craig 12-year-old would be used. “It was right the first time,” recalled Siegal of the drink. He christened it the Gold Rush. Milk & Honey famously lacked a menu back then. Drink orders were arrived at through a conversation between the server and customer. Soon the Gold Rush was being suggested to whiskey lovers. By early 2002, it was a staple at the bar. The key to the drink is the sweetener, and not just because it’s honey. The honey syrup was not a simple equal-parts affair; it was a rich syrup, made of three parts honey and one part water. The result, as far as the Gold Rush was concerned, was a Whiskey Sour so silky and deeply flavored that it led to an “aha!” moment for many people not yet sold on the culinary possibilities of a craft cocktail. The Gold Rush would eventually be surpassed as Milk & Honey’s most famous creation by the Penicillin (this page), another Whiskey Sour variation. But Siegal can take a little credit there as well, because the Penicillin (made of blended scotch, lemon juice, honey-ginger syrup, and a float of single-malt Scotch whisky) was partly inspired by the Gold Rush. Bartender Theo Lieberman added his own tweak when, in 2010, he invented what he called the “regal shake,” in which he shook up sours with a piece of grapefruit peel. “Not only did it totally change the flavor profile, it would also change the texture,” said Lieberman. The Gold Rush responded beautifully to the technique. “It really helps with anything with honey in it, because it cuts the sweetness and richness.”","ingredients":["2 ounces bourbon","¾ ounce lemon juice","¾ ounce rich honey syrup (3:1)"],"steps":["Combine the ingredients in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

The drink was created by Kirk Estopinal and Maksym Pazuniak, two New Orleans bartenders who worked at Cure, the first major craft cocktail bar to open in the city. Estopinal had worked at The Violet Hour in Chicago, where he retreated after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. There he served The Violet Hour version of the Pimm's No. 1 Cup (a favorite drink at the legendary New Orleans bar Napoleon House), which called for muddled strawberries and cucumbers. Estopinal and Pazuniak took that formula and, quite quixotically, substituted Peychaud’s for the Pimm's No. 1—two liquids that have very little in common except that their ingredient lists are secret and they are bright red. A few more tweaks—including the addition of yet another ruby beverage, the nonalcoholic Italian aperitivo Sanbitter—and they arrived at the Gunshop Fizz. The creation of the drink helped lead to the publication of Rogue Cocktails, a 2009 collection of similarly unorthodox cocktails. Because of the drink’s costliness, it is not widely served, but within cocktail circles it is known.","ingredients":["2 ounces Peychaud’s bitters","1 ounce lemon juice","1 ounce simple syrup","2 strawberries","3 cucumber slices","3 swaths of grapefruit peel","3 swaths of orange peel","1 ounce Sanbitter","Cucumber slice for garnish"],"steps":["Muddle all ingredients except the Sanbitter and cucumber garnish at the bottom of a cocktail shaker.

An ancient liqueur, strongly flavored, bitter, and difficult to like, it checked a lot of boxes for brash young mixologists. One of them was Damon Boelte, who learned of Fernet while working at the legendary Brooklyn liquor store LeNell’s. He applied those lessons when, in 2009, he was appointed beverage director at Prime Meats in the same borough. Boelte had ambitions to create a cocktail that had the most Fernet in it. He first achieved this goal with a drink called the Waterfront, which contained a whopping three ounces of the stuff. The drink started out as a mix of Branca Menta (Fernet’s minty counterpart), lime, and ginger ale. From there, it evolved into a split-based mule of sorts, with a 2:1 ratio of Fernet Branca to Branca Menta, and lime, ginger beer, and mint. The Waterfront enjoyed steady popularity at Prime Meats, but it was its abbreviated child that would achieve true fame. In the middle of a brutal brunch service one morning, Boelte’s general manager, Bill, asked him for something to ease the pain. Boelte grabbed both Branca Menta and Fernet Branca and poured them into two small rocks glasses. After drinking his, Bill came back to the bar and asked, “Hey man, what the fuck was that?!” Boelte replied that it was “a Waterfront without all the bullshit in it.” When Bill said the effect of the shot reminded him of when you roll a motorcycle downhill and pop the clutch to get it going, Boelte christened the drink the Hard Start. Word of the secret shot spread quickly. Soon it was put on the dessert menu as an after-dinner drink. But people ordered it at all times of day. When Boelte left Prime Meats to open Grand Army in 2015 nearby, the drink followed him and sold just as well. The drink’s notoriety was pushed along by its portability. A Hard Start can be mixed up anywhere Fernet is sold (which is nearly everywhere). “It travels well as a boomerang,” said Boelte, mentioning the clandestine habit bartenders have of sending fellow barkeeps single-serving cocktails from one bar to another. “I even sent a Hard Start hidden in an [miniature] Underberg bottle to Bill after he moved to Texas. I heard he cried.”","ingredients":["½ ounce Fernet Branca","½ ounce Branca Menta"],"steps":["Combine the ingredients in a shot glass and serve."],"tags":["shot"]},{"name":"Jasmine","author":"Paul Harrington","year":1990,"notes":"The Jasmine is one of the earliest entries in the modern classic cocktail canon, coming just a couple of years after the creation of the Cosmopolitan (with which it shares a pink hue and to which it is often compared) and just as bartender Dale DeGroff, an acknowledged founder of the cocktail renaissance, was beginning to earn a reputation for liquid wizardry at New York’s Rainbow Room. In fact, DeGroff played an indirect role in the creation of the Jasmine. In 1989, chef Evelyne Slomon had just moved to Berkeley and was looking for a place to find a good cocktail. In New York she had been spoiled by her friend DeGroff, who had tested all his Rainbow Room creations on her. While visiting friends at a restaurant in Emeryville, she discovered Townhouse, a former speakeasy that had recently been refurbished and reopened by Joseph LeBrun. She quickly became a regular. She taught novice bartender Paul Harrington how to make a Martini the way she liked it. Many cocktail-oriented discussions followed. Townhouse had no cocktail menu. Harrington got in the habit of asking customers what they liked to drink and what they were in the mood for. Acting on that information, he chose a drink for them from the existing catalog of cocktails. The Jasmine came about one slow weekday night when Matt Jasmin, an infrequent guest at Townhouse, walked in. He asked Harrington to make him something he had never made before. In Harrington’s recently acquired copy of Trader Vic’s Bartender’s Guide, he’d read about the Pegu Club, an old pre-Prohibition drink made of gin, curaçao, lime juice, and bitters. Staring at his backbar that night, his gaze fell on the Campari bottle. “I used to make my Pegu with a fair amount of bitters,” said Harrington, “so when I eyed the Campari, a light went on, and I thought I could make a substitution.” A full basket of fresh lemons on the bar inspired him to replace the Pegu’s lime juice with lemon juice and garnish the drink with a lemon twist. He named it after Jasmin. (Harrington did not discover until many years later that he had misspelled his friend’s name, which lacks an “e.” By then it was too late; the “Jasmine” it was.) During the 1990s, Harrington connected with some editors of the then-new magazine Wired, and they collaborated on CocktailTime.com, a series of cocktail columns that ran on Wired’s new website, Hotwired.com. In 1998, those columns were gathered in Cocktail: The Drinks Bible for the 21st Century, a collaboration with Wired editor Laura Moorhead. Cocktail did indeed become one of the early bibles of the mixology movement for dozens of striving bartenders thirsting for knowledge, including Tony Abou-Ganim. Abou-Ganim was one of the reigning bartenders of the San Francisco scene, where he presided over the swanky Starlight Room. When he moved to Las Vegas to become the beverage director at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, he took the book with him, buying fifty copies for his staff. The drink became the signature cocktail for the Bellagio’s high-end Chinese restaurant, also named Jasmine. As for the man the cocktail is named after, all this history passed by unnoticed. After that first Jasmine cocktail at Townhouse, Matt Jasmin never drank another. He never made the drink at home and never asked for it at bars. When, in 2021, this reporter contacted him about the subject, he was surprised. “I guess I still don’t appreciate it as much as I should,” said Jasmin. “I think I’ll start asking for it the next time I am out.”","ingredients":["1½ ounces gin","¾ ounce lemon juice","¼ ounce Cointreau","¼ ounce Campari","Lemon twist for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

The drink debuted at the latter and sold well enough, but it didn’t achieve mass appeal until Castro began serving it at the more populist-leaning, high-volume bar Rickhouse. Soon after, bartenders began complaining to Castro because customers asked for the drink at their bars. By 2015, it had been adopted by chain restaurants, including some of Guy Fieri’s venues.

One day in late fall of that year, liquor importer Eric Seed, a Minnesota Johnny Appleseed whose bags were full of not seeds but rare elixirs, walked into the dark, low-ceilinged cavern known as Death & Co. The East Village cocktail bar had been open for only two years or so but was the epicenter of cocktail creativity in New York. It was therefore one of the first stops Seed made whenever he was in town with a new bottle of liquid magic. On this occasion, the specimen was Smith & Cross, a navy-strength Jamaican-style rum. Standing behind the bar was Phil Ward, Death & Co.’s taciturn head bartender, and Joaquín Simó, Ward’s more approachable junior colleague. Both had been on the staff since opening day. The reaction was positive. “I remember comments of 'Hey, it’s got the hogo!'” recalled Seed, using the rum term meant to evoke a certain hard-to-define gamey funkiness. Simó did not wait to discover the rum’s mixability potential. He immediately grabbed the bottle and began to build a rum Negroni on the spot—a straightforward application of Ward’s “Mr. Potato Head” school of mixology, in which one ingredient in a classic cocktail recipe is replaced with something broadly similar in character. Simó was not a fan of the then-popular Italian vermouth Carpano Antica. He found it to be a bully that aggressively dominated drinks. But in this case, it made sense. “Smith & Cross is no shrinking violet, so it stands up to the bombastic chocolate and bitter orange notes in the vermouth while drying out the Campari’s richness and tempering its bitterness,” he explained. The Kingston Negroni went on the Death & Co. menu in spring of 2010. Simó recalls the cocktail being a hit right away, going over big with its hardcore clientele, then thirsty for anything new in the “brown, boozy, and stirred” category. That said, the drink was a bit of a sleeper, one that has really come into its own only in the last two or three years. There are several arguable reasons for the increase in popularity, among them the recent flowering of rum and tiki culture and the rise of home bartending (the three-ingredient, equal-parts Kingston Negroni is very easy to make). But perhaps no trend lifted the cocktail’s reputation more than the popularity of the original Negroni, which has exploded in the last several years. Simó is still not sure what possessed him that fateful day in 2009 when—faced with a spirit that he described as redolent of grilled banana bread and smoking allspice branches—he suddenly thought: aperitivo! “It’s certainly not the most imaginative thing I’ve ever done,” he admitted, “but it still strikes me as strange.”","ingredients":["1 ounce Smith & Cross Jamaican rum","1 ounce Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth","1 ounce Campari","Orange twist for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a mixing glass half-filled with ice.

That’s what happened to Jacques Bezuidenhout in 2004 while working at Peche, a Venetian small-plates restaurant in San Francisco. There was a bottle of manzanilla sherry sitting on the shelf that nobody ordered. He mixed it with the Gran Centenario reposado tequila he had been enjoying lately. The result was bone dry, so some sweetness was needed. He thought perhaps the Belle de Brillet pear liqueur being used in another drink on the menu could do the trick. It did. He named the drink after a tequila-focused restaurant in London run by tequila expert Tomas Estes. Then he entered it in a local sherry cocktail competition and won. At Bezuidenhout’s next job, the Mexican restaurant Tres Agaves, La Perla made its first menu appearance.

It’s a simple, three-ingredient cocktail, made of rye, sweet vermouth, and the Italian liqueur Cynar. Everything about the cocktail spoke to the mixology passions of the moment. Manhattan riffs were rampant—the Red Hook and Greenpoint, to name two—and rye was newly ascendant at the time. Amari, too, were being rediscovered. The idea of adding an amaro instead of bitters to a Manhattan occurred to her during a dinner at the New York restaurant Raoul’s. “We were drinking Manhattans right then, and I wondered what one would be like if I substituted Cynar for the Angostura bitters,” she said. “Rittenhouse tied it together.”","ingredients":["2 ounces Rittenhouse bonded rye","¾ ounce Martini & Rossi red vermouth","½ ounce Cynar","Brandied cherry for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a mixing glass half-filled with ice.

There, in 2007 at Death & Co., Phil Ward created the Oaxaca Old-Fashioned. One year later, Jim Meehan, partly inspired by the Oaxaca Old-Fashioned, came up with the Mezcal Mule at PDT. “I was intrigued with how spirits—peated whisky and mezcal—could be used to impart a smoky quality to cocktails,” said Meehan. “There’s an old maxim in the wine world that ‘if it grows with it, it goes with it.’ I brought this concept into the development process. Passion fruit is common in Mexico and has a heady aroma reminiscent of many mezcals’ natural, open-vat fermentation. Cucumber, also common, reinforces the vegetal character of the spirit, while the lime and ginger add acidity and earthiness, respectively. A pinch of Mexican chili, which is commonly added to the slices of jicama and oranges served as snacks in mezcalerias, adds heat and more earth.” Like the Oaxaca Old-Fashioned, the influence of the Mezcal Mule can be seen not only in the number of times it has appeared on cocktail menus but also in the number of imitators it bred.

The bar was Death & Co. in Manhattan in 2007; the owner, David Kaplan; the bartender, Phil Ward; the spirit, mezcal—at the time little used or understood in bartending circles. The something wonderful? The Oaxaca Old-Fashioned, a simple tequila and mezcal twist on the classic cocktail, introducing hordes of bartenders and drinkers to the versatility of agave spirits. The drink—composed of reposado tequila, mezcal, two dashes of Angostura bitters, and a barspoon of the then-novel agave syrup, garnished with a flamed Orange twist—would go on to be served and imitated the world over, leading to a wave of adventurous new cocktails made with tequila and mezcal—spirits that rarely ventured beyond shots and Margaritas. A dozen years after the cocktail’s creation, Death & Co. cemented its status by putting the Oaxaca Old-Fashioned on a T-shirt. Ward, like most New York bartenders, was new to mezcal at the time. The Oaxaca Old-Fashioned was only the third cocktail in which he used it, the first being a simple Daiquiri with a quarter ounce of mezcal thrown in. The second was a drink called the Cinder, another Daiquiri twist, this one fueled by reposado tequila, jalapeño-infused blanco tequila, and mezcal. Ward doesn’t remember whom he made the first Oaxaca Old-Fashioned for, but he recalls the drink as a “right-off-the-cuff humdinger. The Oaxaca was invented in my favorite time of Death & Co.,” Ward recalled. “I feel like it was one big cocktail lab with a slew of guinea pigs—regulars—who would anxiously await the new works in progress every visit.” The cocktail was an immediate favorite. It benefited from not just the novelty of its split spirit base, but also the then-soaring fortunes of the Old-Fashioned. The long-dormant classic cocktail was just beginning to experience a new popularity. For many customers, the comforting format of the straightforward Old-Fashioned acted as a Trojan horse for the untried pleasures of mezcal. The flamed Orange twist, an eye-catching “ta-da!” that completed the cocktail, undoubtedly boosted the drink’s popularity. “Everyone loves pyrotechnics, and I think flamed Orange twists get people’s eye,” said bartender Ivy Mix. “It’s called the fajita effect!”\t In its earliest rendition, the cocktail was made with El Tesoro reposado tequila and Los Amantes Joven mezcal—ingredients that today are too expensive for most bar programs. But with each new swapped-in tequila or mezcal, the Oaxaca Old-Fashioned demonstrated its endurance. For Death & Co. owner David Kaplan, the Oaxaca Old-Fashioned was a fait accompli, a cocktail that was destined to be. “It was a drink that needed to be made,” he said, “that probably should have existed already.”","ingredients":["1½ ounces El Tesoro Reposado tequila","½ ounce mezcal, preferably Del Maguey San Luis Del Rio","2 dashes Angostura bitters","1 barspoon agave nectar","Flamed Orange twist for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a rocks glass filled with one large piece of ice.

It had its coming-out party at Bemelmans Bar, the 1940s lounge inside the Carlyle. A Champagne drink seemed a natural choice for the timeless, low-lit space, which brims with Old World style and charm. Saunders read her audience correctly. “After its launch, the Old Cuban took off almost immediately, like a horse out of the gate,” she recalled. The Old Cuban might have remained a local favorite had it not been for the Carlyle’s relationship with the Ritz London. The two hotels, which shared a similar moneyed, stylish clientele, often took part in co-promotions. In 2002, the Carlyle sent Saunders to London to do a Bemelmans pop-up at the Ritz. She brought the Old Cuban with her, introducing the drink to a whole new continent. Soon after, the cocktail started landing on menus in London, Paris, and Berlin. She recalled write-ups mentioning the cocktail in numerous British and European publications, including the Financial Times and the Independent, among others. “This early period of international press coverage during those trips played a large role in helping the Old Cuban make its way around the world,” says Sanders.","ingredients":["1½ ounces aged rum, preferably Bacardi 8 Year Reserva rum","1 ounce simple syrup","¾ ounce lime juice","2 dashes Angostura bitters","6 whole mint leaves","2 ounces Champagne"],"steps":["Muddle the mint leaves, simple syrup, and lime juice at the bottom of a cocktail shaker.

Ross came up with a drink he called the Paper Plane, after a song by M.I.A. (The tune’s name is actually “Paper Planes.”) The drink first served at The Violet Hour contained Campari. That Italian aperitivo was original to the drink that Ross conceived as an equal-parts riff on the Last Word, the pre-Prohibition cocktail that was resurrected in the aughts by Seattle bartender Murray Stenson. Ross combined the Campari with lemon juice as the citrus element, bourbon as the spirit, and Amaro Nonino, which Ross had recently discovered, as the herbal part of the equation. But two days later, he was having second thoughts. “I tried it again, and the drink wasn’t quite balanced,” Ross remembered. “It was slightly too bitter, and the sweetness wasn’t there.” He subbed in Aperol for the Campari and was immediately satisfied with the result. Thus was born the bright orange drink that has gone on to conquer the world while inspiring riffs of its own, a shirt, and even a bar’s name. That the Paper Plane took flight was predictable; Ross created it with that purpose. He wanted to invent a drink that was not only balanced and delicious but straightforward, too, relying on four readily available ingredients and requiring no special syrups or infusions. In other words, a cocktail that could be whipped up at any spot with a decent backbar or even at home. The drink doesn’t even have a garnish. Today, the Paper Plane has reached such a level of fame that, thirteen years after its creation, it has begun to raise the question: Is it now more popular than Ross’s other modern classic cocktail, the Penicillin? “I still think the Penicillin is more popular, but I’m actually prouder of the Paper Plane because of its simplicity, deliciousness, and its uniqueness,” said Ross. “I had never had anything that tasted like that before.”","ingredients":["¾ ounce bourbon","¾ ounce Amaro Nonino","¾ ounce Aperol","¾ ounce lemon juice"],"steps":["Combine the ingredients in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

It was partly inspired by the Gold Rush (this page), another honeyed Whiskey Sour spin also invented at Milk & Honey. The delivery of a shipment of products from Compass Box—an iconoclastic Scotland company that spends its time smashing various suppositions about how scotch should be made and used—led him to spin on the drink. Out went the bourbon, in went blended scotch; the bar’s house honey syrup and ginger juice were combined into one syrup; and the whole was topped with a float of smoky Islay scotch. A garnish of candied ginger added a bit of flourish. The name was just common sense. Everything about the recipe—whiskey, lemon, honey, ginger—evoked centuries-old home remedies. The drink first caught fire at Little Branch, Milk & Honey’s sister bar in Greenwich Village. Then Ross brought it to the West Coast when he did some consultancy work in Los Angeles. The Penicillin has shown great versatility over the years. There have been dozens of takes on the cocktail in bars around the world. Ross is not above stealing from himself.

Other cocktails take their time yet end up in the same rarefied territory. The Piña Verde, a boozy, herbal twist on the Piña Colada, is one such dark horse. San Diego bartender Erick Castro admits it took years for the simple, four-ingredient drink—green Chartreuse, pineapple juice, lime juice, and coconut cream—to come together. And then it took a few additional years to catch on. All told, the drink’s climb to popularity lasted nearly a decade. It all began with a little bartender trick, designed to make a good drink better—or, at least, stronger. “I first started with the move of floating green Chartreuse over Piña Coladas,” said Castro, recalling a technique he employed in the late aughts. When he became a brand ambassador for Beefeater London Dry gin in 2010, Castro experimented with switching out the traditional rum in the drink for gin. In time, Castro came to realize that what he liked most about the cocktail was the interplay between the Chartreuse and coconut. So he ditched the gin altogether and allowed the overproof French herbal liqueur to step into the starring role. Castro put the drink on the menu at Polite Provisions, the cocktail bar he cofounded in San Diego in 2012, sometime during the bar’s first year of operation. It was then that the drink finally got a proper name. Still, the drink didn’t really take off until its debut on the opposite coast, on the opening menu at New York’s Boilermaker. The drink first gained traction with industry types. To them, esoteric and challenging heritage products—such as Chartreuse—were culinary catnip and all but guaranteed an order. Local bartenders would sidle up to the bar and ask for “that green Chartreuse drink” they had heard about. Once guests found out what all the bartenders were ordering, they wanted it, too. The profile of the drink received an additional boost from the tiki revival, which was in full flower by 2015 and 2016. “It is one of those recipes that can bridge the divide between speakeasy and tiki bar,” said Castro. It also bridged the divide between high and low drinking, the challenging green liqueur getting along surprisingly well with a traditionally easygoing cocktail.","ingredients":["1½ ounces green Chartreuse","1½ ounces pineapple juice","¾ ounce Coco Lopez coconut cream","½ ounce lime juice","Pineapple frond for garnish","Lime wheel for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnishes in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

When bartender Douglas Ankrah came up with the decadent mixture of passion fruit puree, passion fruit liqueur, vanilla-flavored vodka (originally Cariel), vanilla syrup, and Prosecco, the inviting flavors paired with the ribald handle made it a must-have at his popular London bars. However, what is unexpected is that its popularity would endure for nearly two decades, to the point that in 2019 it was reported to be the most-ordered cocktail in the United Kingdom. To most observers, the appeal of the drink boils down to three things: the lurid name, which almost dares you to order the cocktail; the widely popular components; and the novel presentation. The bubbly is not poured atop the drink, in the form of a royale, but comes in a Sidecar as a chaser. Though widely known as the Porn Star Martini, the drink travels under another name, too: the Maverick Martini, after the Mavericks Gentlemen’s Club, a multilevel strip club in Cape Town, South Africa. In 2002, Ankrah was in Cape Town working on his cocktail book, Shaken and Stirred, and preparing to open a new London bar called Townhouse. He spent his off-hours at the club. It was on this same trip that the cocktail was conceived. According to Ankrah, the drink simply came to him while walking to work one warm summer morning. “Truly, it was a spur of the moment thing,” he said. When Ankrah (who died in August 2021) returned to London, he rechristened it with its second, better-known name. The cocktail was popular from day one. The bartenders at Townhouse and LAB, which were owned by the same people, couldn’t shake them up fast enough. At the time, a new cocktail could not hope for a better launching pad than the two bars, which were not only trendy but also trendsetting. In recent years, the racy name of the cocktail has proven more of a liability than an asset. In 2019, the British supermarket chain Marks & Spencer was compelled to change the name of a canned version of the drink to the toned-down Passion Star Martini. Ankrah, for one, was not surprised that his heady creation from the tail end of the “Cool Britannia” days is still showing legs. “The drink is the ultimate party starter,” he said in 2020, “sexy, fun, and unpretentious.”","ingredients":["1⅓ ounces vanilla-flavored vodka","1⅔ ounces passion fruit puree","½ ounce Passoã passion fruit liqueur","2 barspoons Vanilla Syrup","1 ounce Prosecco"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the Prosecco in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

But if you felt like something similar, just a bit different, your choices were limited. There was the Perfect Manhattan, with equal parts sweet and dry vermouth, or a Rob Roy, the scotch version of the cocktail. By the late aughts, however, that all changed. Options for Manhattan-like cocktails increased exponentially. You could order a Little Italy, made of rye, sweet vermouth, and Cynar; or a Greenpoint, made of rye, sweet vermouth, Yellow Chartreuse, and bitters. There were also the Carroll Gardens, Bushwick, Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn Heights, and the Slope—all named after Brooklyn neighborhoods and all containing rye whiskey, vermouth, and usually something bitter. That trend all began with the Red Hook cocktail, a hybrid of a Manhattan and a Brooklyn created by Italian bartender Vincenzo Errico at Milk & Honey in 2003. As it was composed of rye, maraschino liqueur, and Punt e Mes—three ingredients that were then still relatively obscure but with a slowly growing reputation in the States—bartenders were immediately drawn to the new cocktail. The drink was one-stop shopping for bartenders hoping to turn their customers on to new flavors. Soon afterward, the flood of Manhattan/Brooklyn riffs began. That almost all of the spin-off drinks had a rye base—as opposed to bourbon, a more common spirit in Manhattans—was no mistake. The Red Hook and its offspring came of age during the rebirth of rye whiskey. Neglected and forgotten for decades, the spicy whiskey found a new home in craft cocktail bars. After 2010, the storm of rye Manhattan riffs died down. But evidence of that era still lingers. Almost twenty years later, the Red Hook remains a common order, arguably the best-known cocktail to be invented by an Italian bartender since the Negroni. And like the Negroni, it remains more popular in the United States than in Italy—where Errico has since returned to open a bar on the island of Ischia.","ingredients":["2 ounces rye","½ ounce maraschino liqueur","½ ounce Punt e Mes"],"steps":["Combine the ingredients in a mixing glass half-filled with ice.

A garnish set on fire. With such sensational elements, perhaps it was preordained that the Revolver, a Manhattan variation created by San Francisco bartender Jon Santer in 2004, should attract attention. But it wasn’t as simple as that. There would be a number of serendipitous steps between the drink’s creation and its subsequent fame. Though it clocks in at just four ingredients, including the garnish—bourbon, coffee liqueur, orange bitters, and a flamed Orange twist—each element was discerningly selected by Santer, who intentionally created a minimal build. One of the crucial ingredients in Santer’s Revolver was inspired by a friend who always added crème de cacao to his Manhattans. That idea stuck with Santer, whose thoughts eventually turned from chocolate to coffee as a flavoring. At the time, there weren’t many coffee liqueurs on the market. Of the few, Santer preferred the rum-based Tia Maria. As for the bourbon in his coffee-laced Manhattan project, the decision was made for Santer; at Bruno’s, the jazz club in San Francisco’s Mission District where Santer worked as bar manager, his boss did the liquor buying. One week, he found himself with a case of Bulleit bourbon, a new whiskey no one was going to call for, because no one knew what it was. To bring the bourbon and Tia Maria together, Santer turned to orange bitters. At the time, bartenders were just rediscovering the once-ubiquitous cocktail ingredient, and only one shop in San Francisco carried it: John Walker & Co. Once a month, Santer would ride his motorcycle down there and buy a few bottles for the bar. As for the eye-catching garnish, Santer gives credit to bartender Dale DeGroff, who made it his trademark. The drink’s name, apart from nodding to the bourbon brand, evoked the gunsmoke aroma emitted by the flamed orange twist. Santer put the Revolver on Bruno’s cocktail list, but the drink didn’t make much of an impression. Bruno’s wasn’t that kind of place. There, most of the guests ordered lagers or whiskey and Cokes; they rarely even looked at the cocktail menu. Instead, it became a drink ordered by fellow bartenders. It wasn’t until the opening of Bourbon & Branch in the city’s Tenderloin neighborhood in 2006 that the Revolver gained a real foothold. Patterned after the renowned New York bar Milk & Honey, it boosted the city’s cocktail game tenfold. Santer was on the opening bar staff, and his Revolver was the only original cocktail on the debut menu not created by bar director Todd Smith. The trouble was that the menu listed sixty-three drinks, and the Revolver was back on page ten. The cocktail’s fortunes shifted when, a half a year after opening, the wildly popular Bourbon & Branch opened the Library, a standing-only, no-reservations space within the same Jones Street address. The Library’s menu listed only a few drinks, and the Revolver was one of them. Bartenders were making fifty to seventy-five Revolvers a night. “I remember my Library colleagues complaining about blackened fingertips from flaming so many orange discs,” said Santer. When the Revolver was subsequently adopted by Milk & Honey and all of Sasha Petraske’s other associated bars, including Little Branch and Dutch Kills, its bona fides were certified. Soon Santer was being sent pictures of Revolver appearances on cocktail lists around the world, from Austria to New Zealand. In 2012, he heard from his friend Patrick Brennan that a bar in Oakland had the Revolver on the menu. When Brennan told the bar manager that his pal Santer—who lived nearby—had invented the drink, the manager scoffed. “The bar manager told my friend the Revolver was a classic from a long time ago,” said Santer. “Older than dirt.”","ingredients":["2 ounces Bulleit bourbon","½ ounce coffee liqueur","2 dashes orange bitters","Flamed Orange twist"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a mixing glass half-filled with ice.

In 2006, when Katie Stipe was just starting her bartending career at Flatiron Lounge—one of the early hotbeds of modern mixology in New York City—she came up with the Siesta. A spin on the Hemingway Daiquiri, it combined tequila, lime and grapefruit juices, simple syrup, and Campari. What made the Siesta challenging in 2006 were the two ingredients Stipe substituted for the Hemingway Daiquiri’s usual rum and maraschino liqueur—tequila and Campari. The cocktail bartending community was only starting to reevaluate tequila as a liquor worthy of respect; the spirit was rarely encountered by drinkers in any form beyond the Margarita and Tequila Sunrise. News of the Siesta spread slowly, mainly by word of mouth. Flatiron was a wellspring of mixology talent, and when bartenders left to pilot other bar programs, they took their recipe knowledge with them, organically building the audience of a given drink. But the Siesta may have found its true megaphone in the form of Speed Rack, the roving cocktail contest founded in 2011 by Lynnette Marrero and Ivy Mix to highlight the talents of female bartenders nationwide, while simultaneously raising money for breast cancer education, prevention, and research. In each round of Speed Rack competition, bartenders are called upon to create several drinks from memory as fast and accurately as possible. Thrown into the mix of possible drinks, beginning in 2015, was Stipe’s Siesta. It has since been featured in Speed Rack bouts in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Stipe went on from Flatiron to work at more than a dozen bars. The list of original cocktails she has invented is hundreds long.

Instead, he’d rather hone his execution of long-established classic cocktails. “Agave spirits are a bit of an exception because they are less represented in the canon.” Mezcals run the gamut in flavor, from vegetal to fruity. The latter style reminded Vogler of pineapple, so in 2008 he paired it with a pineapple gum syrup that he had developed with Jennifer Colliau to use in Pisco Punch. (Colliau went on to found Small Hand Foods, which now commercially produces the syrup.) He put it on the opening menu at Beretta, a pizzeria with a top-shelf cocktail program of his devising. It was a popular order right off. “Beretta and my home were and are in the Mission, the Spanish-speaking part of the city,” said Vogler. “I wanted to represent the spirit in the neighborhood, and it’s such a beautiful spirit. Also, I’m interested in provenance with spirits, so the single village mezcals were some of the few spirits that are traceable that way.” He later featured it on the menu of his first bar and restaurant, the influential Bar Agricole. “I feel it’s emblematic of my career,” he said. “The drink is simple.

For those hoping to pin down an exact year of origin, abandon all hope. “There is no date,” said its creator, Julio Bermejo, whose family owns Tommy’s Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco, for which the drink is named. “The style of Margarita made by Tommy’s evolved.” The seeds of the drink were planted when Bermejo was not yet of drinking age. Like many teenagers, he experimented with booze. Beer, rum, and brandy left him with bad hangovers. But he found that tequila—filched from Tommy’s, his family’s restaurant in the Richmond District—didn’t do as much damage. And Herradura tequila in particular, made of 100 percent agave, left his brain largely unscathed. Years later, in the late 1980s, when Bermejo took up his post behind the bar at Tommy’s, he drew on that misspent youth and switched out the mixto tequila being used in the house Margarita for Herradura. “Our pour cost went up dramatically,” he recalled, “and the drink’s cost went up only like fifty cents.” But for Bermejo, the change in flavor made it worth it. Though the Tommy’s Margarita is famous for containing no curaçao—a defining ingredient in a Margarita—eighty-sixing that liqueur was never a decision Julio had to make. Triple sec had once been used in the house Marg, which was of the blended sort common in that era. But by the time Bermejo arrived, it had vanished from the recipe, probably for economic reasons, and been supplanted by simple syrup.\tReplacing the simple syrup with agave syrup, however, was Bermejo’s idea. “Agave syrup was a product used mainly by California health-food producers,” he said. “But even though it was expensive, it was a no-brainer for me. It was a product from a similar plant as tequila.” He also traded up from sour mix to freshly squeezed lime juice and discouraged the use of a salted rim, seeing the flourish as unnecessary. Over the years, Bermejo began favoring Margaritas served on the rocks over the blended variety. By the end of the ’90s, Tommy’s Margarita orders had gone from being 95 percent blended to 95 percent on the rocks. For all his innovations, however, Tommy’s Mexican Restaurant was still in the Richmond; Bermejo was working in a vacuum. Then one day in 1995 or 1996, Bermejo was discovered by the greater bartending world in the form of Tony Abou-Ganim, one of the most celebrated bartenders in San Francisco. When Abou-Ganim became the beverage director at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 1997, Bermejo was brought on as a consultant. By then, Tommy’s was beginning to get regular local press about their tequila selection. In 1999, the Wall Street Journal published a long article on tequila and called Tommy’s “the epicenter” of the spirit’s revival. The piece cemented Bermejo’s reputation as a tequila expert. The very last thing to come into focus about the Tommy’s Margarita was the name. And Bermejo had nothing to do with that. He credits two British bartenders, Henry Besant and Dre Masso, with its inadvertent christening. In 2001, Bermejo traveled to the UK and Europe with the Tequila Regulatory Council (known as the CRT) to aid the organization in getting the spirit officially recognized by the EU. Bermejo’s job was to connect to the English-speaking bartenders. In London, he met Dre Masso, who was a bartender at the white-hot LAB bar. The next year, Masso asked permission to visit Bermejo; he spent six months in 2003 listening to Bermejo’s stories and tasting tequila. “It was at this point that I discovered his house cocktail,” said Masso. “When you looked around the bar and restaurant, it seemed every guest had a sipping tequila in one hand and a Tommy’s in the other.” Masso and Besant (who died in 2013) became the drink’s two town criers, telling colleagues about it and talking it up at cocktail demonstrations as founders of the Worldwide Cocktail Club, a consultancy they formed in the mid-aughts. Masso and Besant even opened a Mexican restaurant and tequila bar in London called Green & Red and coauthored Margarita Rocks in 2005, which includes what may be the first book mention of the Tommy’s Margarita.

Robert Hess of Seattle was a tech executive at Microsoft in the 1990s and an amateur home mixologist. He has a soft spot for obscure cocktail ingredients, including bitters. He had been on the hunt for orange bitters—a critical ingredient in an old-school Martini—for years, and he finally found Fee Brothers, a manufacturer in Rochester, New York. Hess ordered a case of each of the bitters they were then making: orange, mint, “old-fashioned,” and peach. The peach bitters became the first building block of an eventual project to build an “obscured Negroni,” as Hess put it. He had already discovered that aquavit made a nifty substitute for gin in the Italian cocktail. Maybe, he surmised, there were other neglected bottles that needed a leg up. For the Campari, he reached for another intense Italian liqueur, the artichoke-informed Cynar. And dry sherry replaced the vermouth. He called the drink the Trident, a nod to the three seafaring countries that produced the trio of liquors. He tested his invention on the bartenders of the Zig Zag Café, the only Seattle bar that could be counted on to have the three main ingredients on hand. (Hess carried the peach bitters on his person wherever he went.) They liked it; so much so that the next time he dropped in, the Trident was on the cocktail menu. Soon the state Liquor Control Board was asking why Zig Zag was ordering more Cynar than all of the other Seattle bars combined. The Trident might have remained strictly a local favorite if Brian Miller, a Seattle native and bartender at the recently opened Pegu Club in New York, had not stopped by the Zig Zag for a drink in late 2005. He was so taken with the Trident that he took the recipe back to Gotham and began selling them at Pegu Club. Exposure on Hess’s own Drinkboy internet chat room, which became a sort of virtual Mermaid Tavern for the cocktail geek set, also boosted the drink’s reputation.","ingredients":["1 ounce fino, manzanilla, or amontillado sherry","1 ounce aquavit","1 ounce Cynar","2 dashes peach bitters","Lemon twist for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a mixing glass half-filled with ice.

In fact, the mysterious model—who, according to legend, asked bartender Dick Bradsell one night at the Soho Brasserie in London in the 1980s for a drink that would “fuck me up and then wake me up”—may not have been a model at all. “He told me he couldn’t even remember who it was and he just assumed she was a model,” says Miranda Dickson, global brand director at Absolut Elyx, who interviewed Bradsell about the drink in 2011, five years before he died. But Beatrice Bradsell, the late bartender’s daughter, insists there was indeed a model. “Unfortunately, I don’t know the name of the model,” said Bradsell. “He took that to the grave. I do know it was a true story, but he loved the mystery that came with the unrevealed identity.” The never-to-be-known woman is just one of many details about the Espresso Martini that have been obscured by the mists of time. Even the very name of the drink is a matter of dispute. It began its long, robust journey through the world’s bars under the prosaic moniker Vodka Espresso. Sometime in the late 1990s it evolved into the Espresso Martini, the name that stuck. It also enjoyed a brief, fevered notoriety from 1998 to 2003 as the Pharmaceutical Stimulant. Along the way, the drink changed as often as its name. The cocktail originally served at the Soho Brasserie on Old Compton Street was an off-menu special Dick Bradsell bestowed on favored friends and colleagues. There was no coffee liqueur in the drink at the time; only, as the name would indicate, shots of vodka and espresso, tied together by a little simple syrup. The mixture was served on the rocks and topped with the now-iconic garnish of three espresso beans. When exactly Bradsell came up with the potion that would become his calling card is likewise a matter of conjecture. Some sources say 1983, but Beatrice Bradsell thinks otherwise. “Dad told me they were filming the David Bowie film Absolute Beginners in Soho at the time,” explained Bradsell. “The film was released in 1986, which makes me think the drink was created in 1985.” But it would take another decade or so for the cocktail to become news. The drink didn’t appear on a menu until Jonathan Downey hired Bradsell at his bar Match EC1, which opened to acclaim in September 1997. “I’m certain hardly anyone would have had this drink or heard of it before Match,” said Downey. “It was hugely popular and a real revelation.” The cocktail served at Match was a transitional version in the drink’s tangled timeline. It still went by the name Vodka Espresso but was made with coffee liqueur in lieu of simple syrup and, critically, was served up in a stemmed glass. According to Beatrice Bradsell, her father had never been completely satisfied with the drink and kept tinkering with it. “He thought of where he wanted it to sit, and his mind went to dessert-style cocktails and the Brandy Alexander,” said Bradsell. “In his mind, the Brandy Alexander works so well because it took two quite different flavors [brandy and cream] and used modifiers to bridge the gaps in the palate. He worked to do the same with his cocktail by using various coffee liqueurs and shaking it to improve the texture.” By the end of the 1990s, these changes had stuck, along with a new name: Espresso Martini. Most people blame the ’tini craze of the 1990s for forcing a new identity on the Vodka Espresso. “Everything was ’tini-tastic in London,” said Dickson. “The Martini was such a movement. That’s when the Vodka Espresso grew into the Espresso Martini.” Dick Bradsell wasn’t quite done with his invention after Match, though. In 1998, Damien Hirst, the English artist who was briefly besotted with cocktail culture, opened his own bar called Pharmacy in Notting Hill. Bradsell, hired to create the drink program, rechristened his Vodka Espresso/Espresso Martini as the Pharmaceutical Stimulant. It was now back on the rocks. Anything Dick Bradsell put his hand to at that point was noteworthy, so the drink, whatever its name, spread like wildfire. As to the drink’s unending appeal, Downey points to the obvious—the one-two punch the cocktail embodies. It’s popular, he said, “for the reasons Dick has so brilliantly shared—it wakes you up and fucks you up!”","ingredients":["2 ounces vodka","1 ounce fresh-brewed espresso","½ ounce coffee liqueur","¼ ounce simple syrup","3 espresso beans for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

But Shady Pines Saloon in Sydney, and later the Baxter Inn in the same city—both owned by the same team, including Anton Forte and Jason Scott—certainly perfected and popularized this unusual highball. Shady Pines, a Western-themed bar, has always had a whiskey focus. A short time after opening, the owners began to pair that whiskey with freshly pressed green apple juice, using a Breville juicer. The novel combination was a hit with the public immediately, partly due to the eye-catching vivid green color of the drink. The cocktail never really had a proper name, and it wasn’t on the menu. (Forte called it “Whiskey Apple.”) People just knew it was available and ordered it. Soon bars across Sydney were serving the drink. Beginning in 2017, the highball hopped the Pacific and began showing up on menus at New York cocktail bars like Diamond Reef, Suffolk Arms, and Peppi’s Cellar (opened by Scott himself). Good-quality Granny Smith apples, freshly pressed, are essential to the success of the drink. The original whiskey used at the beginning was Jim Beam rye, but many other ryes work just as well.","ingredients":["1 ounce rye whiskey","4 ounces freshly pressed Granny Smith apple juice"],"steps":["Combine the ingredients in a highball glass filled with ice.

Such was the case one hot summer night in 2001 in a small town in Bordeaux. Nick Blacknell, then the director of Plymouth Gin, was traveling from England to France to attend Vinexpo, a spirits exhibition, alongside rising London bartender Wayne Collins, who was there to compete in the Drinks International cocktail competition. The day before the contest, they settled into a guesthouse in Médoc. Soon the relentless heat had Blacknell hankering for a bracing, ice-cold Negroni. With no promising bar options in their village, the duo turned to the local liquor store to rustle up the necessary ingredients: traditionally gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth. Once in the store, Collins remembered, they were confronted by the usual array of then rather obscure French liqueurs and aperitifs. “I suggested we make the Negronis with French ingredients, as it seemed more appropriate.” They settled on Suze and Lillet Blanc. Given that both men were in town on gin business, the base spirit remained constant. Later that afternoon and several fairer Negronis later, all garnished with a wedge of fresh pink grapefruit—a twist that Collins was known to favor in Martinis, and one that he thought would lend a bittersweet lift to the drink—Blacknell’s marketing mind went to work. He suggested that, once back home, they should promote the new drink, christened the White Negroni, in the UK. The cocktail did not catch on. Despite the efforts of Collins and Blacknell, it was quietly forgotten for many years. Ironically, the White Negroni got its big break not in the drink’s birthplace or in England, the home of its inventor, but in the United States—at a time when Suze was still unavailable there. In 2002, Simon Ford was hired by Blacknell as brand ambassador for Plymouth gin and charged with turning the vodka-loving United States back into a nation of gin drinkers. He took the White Negroni and ran with it, introducing it and other gin cocktails to any bar owner who had even a passing interest in the spirit. That included Audrey Saunders, then bar director at New York’s Bemelmans Bar in the Hotel Carlyle. To get around the Suze problem, Saunders smuggled bottles on her many trips to and from England. She did the same at Pegu Club after it opened in 2005 and, after stumbling upon a small quantity of Suze online, went one better, putting the drink on the bar’s menu. “Illegal, of course,” admitted Saunders, “but from my part it was more about doing whatever was necessary to expand awareness about artisanal products in those early days.” Eventually, demand for Suze among American bartenders grew strong enough that Pernod Ricard began to import the liqueur in 2012. After that, there was no holding back the White Negroni. As the aughts rolled into the 2010s, the drink’s popularity only increased, raised by the reborn fortunes of the original Negroni and the public’s thirst for any variation—all of which identify Collins as one of the most prescient mixologists of his day.","ingredients":["1 ounce Plymouth gin","1 ounce Lillet Blanc","1 ounce Suze","Grapefruit twist for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a mixing glass half-filled with ice.

This creation by Dick Bradsell, the dean of the London cocktail revival, is one of them. The honoree is Nick Blacknell, a liquor-world executive who has done much over the years to burnish the reputations of Plymouth gin and Havana Club rum, among other labels. According to Blacknell, Bradsell was working at the London bar The Player at the time. One night Blacknell, fairly drunk and dressed up in a woman’s fur coat, confessed he was jealous that Dick had named a drink at Detroit—another London bar Bradwell worked at—after another regular customer. Bradsell responded by whipping up a potion made partly of Plymouth gin and Plymouth sloe gin—logical, given that Blacknell was promoting those brands at the time. “I remember clearly he made it from scratch in a single go, no practice, no pause for thought,” recalled Blacknell. “And we tasted it and it was delicious, with that sweet-sour, yin-yang tanginess and balance from the sloe, mure, and grapefruit.” Blacknell wanted to call it the Nick Martini. Bradsell didn’t think that was a very good handle. He suggested the Weeble Martini, named after the toy, as Blacknell always wobbled when he drank, but never fell down. Then he had second thoughts and said, “No, Weeble might sue me. We better call it the Wibble instead.”","ingredients":["1 ounce gin","1 ounce sloe gin","1 ounce grapefruit juice","¾ teaspoon lemon juice","¾ teaspoon simple syrup (2:1)","¾ teaspoon crème de mure","Lemon twist for garnish"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients except the garnish in a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice.

Most people will tell you that the Old Pal is made with Campari, dry vermouth, and rye whiskey—sort of a rye Negroni. But Adam’s research complicates things a bit. He notes that a conflicting recipe appears in the 1927 book: “I remember way back in 1878, on the thirtieth of February to be exact, when the writer was discussing the subject with my old pal ‘Sparrow’ Robertson and he said to yours truly, ‘Get away with that stuff, my old pal, here’s the drink I invented when I fired the pistol the first time at the Powderhall foot races and you can’t go wrong if you put a bet down on ⅓ Canadian Club, ⅓ Eyetalian Vermouth, and ⅓ Campari,’ and then he told the writer that he would dedicate this cocktail to me, and call it, My Old Pal.” There’s no denying that My Old Pal has a Negroni-style template, but if Sparrow Robertson really did invent this drink in 1878, then the My Old Pal predates the Negroni by over forty years. Interesting trivia, if nothing else. Now, here’s where the modern-day expert’s feathers will get ruffled: the 1927 book calls for “Eyetalian Vermouth,” meaning sweet vermouth.

In his 1927 book Barflies and Cocktails, he proclaims, “Now is the time for all good barflies to come to the aid of the party, since Erskinne (sic) Gwynne crashed in with his Boulevardier cocktail: ⅓ Campari, ⅓ Italian vermouth, ⅓ Bourbon whiskey.” His Boulevardier—like his My Old Pal!—calls for sweet vermouth. Cocktail purists will probably try to tell you that the Old Pal has to be made with dry vermouth and that the Boulevardier has to be made with sweet vermouth. I say pour me a drink and let’s move on. Actually, let’s pause for a moment to reflect upon the Boulevardier. The name is a nod to a Parisian magazine along the lines of the New Yorker. The Erksine McElhone speaks of was the son of Edward Erskine and Helen Steele Gwynne, and his great-uncle was Cornelius Vanderbilt. Erskine was a wealthy man, as one might imagine. Erskine’s sister, Alice “Kiki” Gwynne, was a notorious drug addict, often referred to as “the girl with the silver syringe,” and one of her three children was thought to have been fathered by Prince George, Duke of Kent, one of King George V of England’s sons. The Boulevardier magazine began publication in 1927 (the same year in which Barflies and Cocktails hit the shelves), and while lofty writers such as Ernest Hemingway and Noel Coward were contributing to its pages, the proud publisher undoubtedly quaffed quality cocktails in the City of Lights.","ingredients":["1 ounce bourbon","1 ounce sweet vermouth","1 ounce Campari","Garnish: 1 orange slice, lemon twist, or cherry"],"steps":["Stir all the ingredients long and well with ice in a mixing glass, then strain into a cocktail glass.

The Alexandria Hotel Cocktail first saw light of day in 2009, when Marcos helped to put together the Los Angeles Sub-District Cocktail Competition. His idea was to emulate New York City, which early on had the Manhattan, Bronx, and Brooklyn cocktails, then later the Red Hook, Greenpoint, Little Italy, Bensonhurst, and so on. Marcos even went so far as to emulate the style of these signature New York City drinks, making it a rule of the competition that the drinks must be stirred cocktails made using a base spirit, modifying vermouth, liqueur or a sweetening agent, and some type of bitters, without citrus, homemade ingredients, or extremely obscure, hard-to-find ingredients.” The old Alexandria Hotel was an iconic Los Angeles spot and, according to Tello, “a magnet for old, glamorous Hollywood.

Tony is one of the world’s preeminent bartenders, and the man behind 69 Colebrooke Row—a fantastic, wildly inventive bar in London’s Islington neighborhood. Tony is known for doing weird and wonderful things with cocktails—including using tools and techniques from molecular gastronomy, like Rotavapors and sous-vide machines, to create custom ingredients. But for all his technological wizardry, Tony still loves a good classic. He says, “I love Negronis because to me they are the signifier for aperitivo. As an Italian, I so appreciate that as a cultural concept. The aperitivo says, Work is over. It’s time to open your palate and start to enjoy your night! But being me, I couldn’t just let the Negroni be a Negroni! I wanted to see what else I could do with it—what other directions it could take. “I first started aging Negronis five years ago. We had great success with Manhattans and wanted to see what else we could use the process with. When you age a cocktail, it mellows considerably; the different spirits combine on a molecular level and come together beautifully. We started flash-fusing ingredients for the Negroni in the sous-vide to see if we could approximate the effect of aging without the time commitment. We experimented with periods between one and twenty-four hours. “We found that the longer you cooked it, the more it tasted like it had been aged in the bottle for a long time. We started serving these ‘vint-aged’ Negronis at the bar, and they were a great hit. It was fantastic to discover something that created the effect of aging without having to stick a lot of bottles in the cellar! ”Few people have access to sous-vide machines, and I’m not one of the few, so instead of flash-fusing (combining the three ingredients, vacuum-sealing them in a bag, and dropping it into a sous-vide machine for a certain amount of time), I allow my vint-aged Negronis to mature slowly, in bottles. It takes longer, but you get there in the end. The bottled Negronis make great favors to take to parties. When you open and serve them—over ice in a double old-fashioned glass—be sure to have some freshly cut Orange twists handy for garnishes.","ingredients":["1 (750mL) bottle gin","1 (750 mL) bottle Campari","1 (750 mL) bottle sweet vermouth"],"steps":["Stir all the ingredients together in a large container. Decant into smaller bottles. (I like to reuse and relabel the original gin, vermouth, and Campari bottles.) Store out of direct sunlight for at least 1 month, at which point subtle changes in flavor should be detectable. In theory, you could age these Negronis indefinitely, but chances are you won’t. Six months of aging makes an incredible difference, and to be honest, I’ve never managed to store my Negronis any longer than that."],"tags":["negroni","the large-format negronis","punch"]},{"name":"Barrel-Aged Negronis","author":"Jeffrey Mogenthaler","notes":"Makes about 3 gallons; serves about 128. Jeffrey has been, and continues to be, a leading force in the twenty-first-century bartending and cocktailian movement. He visited Tony Conigliaro at 69 Colebrooke Row in London in 2010 and, inspired by Conigliaro’s Manhattans aged in glass vessels, he returned to Portland to try his hand at barrel-aged cocktails, which he calls “a decidedly American curiosity.” On his popular, eponymous blog, Jeffrey Morgenthaler discusses his approach: “The rub of aging cocktails in a glass bottle is that the whole premise is built upon subtlety, as we know that spirits aged in glass or steel do so at an unremarkable pace. Being from the United States, where—as everyone is aware—bigger equals better, I pondered the following question: What if you could prepare a large batch of a single, spirit-driven cocktail and age it in a used oak barrel?“ A hundred some-odd dollars in liquor later, I was nervously pouring a gallon of pre-batched rye Manhattans into a small, used oak cask whose previous contents were Madeira wine. I plugged the barrel and sat back in anxious anticipation. If the experiment was a success, I’d have a delicious cocktail to share at the bar; if it was a failure, then I’d be pouring the restaurant’s money down the floor drain. “Over the next several weeks I popped open the barrel to test my little concoction until I stumbled upon the magic mark at five to six weeks. And there it was, lying beautifully on the finish: a soft blend of oak, wine, caramel, and char. That first batch sold out in a matter of days, and I was left with a compelling need to push the process even further.” Morgenthaler’s Manhattan project was a success, and he soon moved on to Negronis: “After six weeks in the bourbon barrel, our Negroni emerged a rare beauty: the sweet vermouth so slightly oxidized, the color paler and rosier than the original, the mid-palate softly mingled with whiskey, the finish long and lingering with oak tannins. We knew we were onto something unique and immediately made plans to take the cask-aging program to the next level.” Now even home bartenders are exploring barrel aging, benefiting from the fact that it’s quite easy to order used (or new) oak barrels online. One reliable source for used whiskey barrels is the online store at Tuthilltown Spirits in New York. They sell 3-gallon charred oak barrels that were previously used for whiskey. Three gallons yields about 128 drinks—perfect for a large party, a wedding, or a particularly boozy family reunion. Morgenthaler decants his cocktails into glass vessels. However, you can also drill a hole into the side of the barrel and insert a spigot; any home brew, wine-making, or vinegar-making shop should supply spigots, and they might even drill the hole for you.","ingredients":["5 (750 mL) bottles dry gin","5 (750 mL) bottles sweet vermouth","5 (750 mL) bottles Campari"],"steps":["Stir all the ingredients together in a large container.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, preferences were probably fairly evenly split and depended heavily on region. In the decades after Prohibition, bourbon slowly but surely developed an edge, and rye, thought old-fashioned and somewhat disreputable (The Lost Weekend, etc.), fell into eclipse. In recent years, rye has made a big comeback, so drinkers once again have a choice. Doctrinaire purists tend to insist on rye, thinking it the more historically authentic choice, but both function admirably. Simply put, bourbon will give you a mellower and sweeter cocktail, whereas rye will deliver a bit more spice and kick. Among American whiskeys that provide the best value for their price—and make an outstanding Old-Fashioned—I recommend Elijah Craig 12-year and Henry McKenna single barrel (make sure it’s the bonded) bourbons, and Rittenhouse 100-proof and Bulleit Rye Whiskeys. (McKenna, which can be difficult to find outside Kentucky, strikes a nice balance, spice-wise, between the Elijah Craig and Rittenhouse).","ingredients":["2 ounces rye or bourbon","1 sugar cube (or ¼ ounce simple syrup)","2 dashes Angostura bitters","Orange twist"],"steps":["Muddle the sugar, bitters, and a barspoon of warm water at the bottom of an Old-Fashioned glass until the sugar is dissolved.

Still, it remains an oddball choice. You’re one in two hundred if you order one, and very likely you love your chosen brand of Scotch a trifle more than you cherish the Old-Fashioned. Historical cocktail books are particularly frustrating regarding this cocktail; they rarely specify anything other than “Scotch,” never a brand or type. Since the drink emerged in the days when single malts were all but unknown on American soil, blended Scotch—Famous Grouse and Bank Note do nicely—is the natural choice for a classic Scotch Old-Fashioned.","ingredients":["2 ounces blended Scotch","1 sugar cube (or ¼ ounce simple syrup)","2 dashes Angostura bitters","Orange twist"],"steps":["Muddle the sugar, bitters, and a barspoon of warm water at the bottom of an Old-Fashioned glass until the sugar is dissolved.

The Guatemalan solera-aged Zacapa is arguably the ne plus ultra for this particular drink. But the Ron Abuelo 7-year from Panama works very well, too, and is perhaps not as overwhelmingly opulent. Also excellent for this drink are the El Dorado 8-year, made in Guyana. That said, the recipe I include here comes from bartender St. John Frizell, who owns Fort Defiance, a fine bar in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. Frizell is a fan of English Harbour rum. If you can’t find the excellent Clement cane syrup, which hails from Martinique, you may want to experiment with the sweetener. Molasses is a natural companion to rum.

If you can find the headier, more full-bodied barrel-aged Bols (which tastes very similar to the Corenwijn, which is sold in Europe, but unavailable here), use it. Also, perhaps due to the fruity, floral character of the Genever, this is the one Old-Fashioned variation that actually benefits from the 1870s bartender habit of adding a dash of this or that.

Since then the drink has become a popular addition to cocktail menus around the world. Says Ward, “The Oaxaca Old-Fashioned was my epiphany drink: ‘Holy shit, this stuff works!’” The stuff was mezcal, tequila’s smokier, rough-hewn cousin, and in this drink it transformed something so simple and basic into something of much greater results than the sum of its parts.

Hishimochi is a rhombus-shaped ceremonial dessert eaten on this day. The wagashi has three layers from top to bottom: pink, white, and green, which represent security, purity, and health or long life, respectively. Inspired by the colorful layers and the intention behind Hinamatsuri, I came up with this bitters and soda variation that is served layered with matcha syrup on the bottom, followed by club soda and a generous dashing of Peychaud’s bitters on top. The matcha brings a semisweet, vegetal quality to the drink, which opens up when paired with the club soda, while the layer of bitters on top brings notes of aniseed and baking spices.

His cocktail of Cognac, Cherry Heering, grenadine, lemon juice, and Curaçao has since secured its place as the standard cocktail bearing the coveted name Cherry Blossom. The drink is a bold red, like American cherries rather than the pale pink and white cherry blossoms of Japan. For this reason, there is a notion that Tao created the drink for Western tourists and businesspeople who were visiting Yokohama, to give them a taste of home. This may or may not be true, but I appreciate the sentiment behind the tale. As with many drinks invented over a hundred years ago, Tao’s original cocktail leans much sweeter than what modern palates tend to appreciate, so for my iteration of the drink I removed the grenadine and brought up the citrus elements, reaching for Royal Combier Grande Liqueur for its profile of orange, vanilla, and spices. The heart of the cocktail remains intact, with the vivacious cherry liqueur shining through, supported by notes of vanilla and oak. It maintains a satisfying amount of sweetness, which I find best suited for a dessert cocktail, perhaps alongside super-dark bitter chocolate or a hearty cheese board.

With a clean, brisk nature, the drink is famously embraced by Japanese bartenders. Lime cordial is what makes the gimlet come alive—the undertone of bitterness complements the gin in a manner that fresh lime juice cannot match. Rose’s Lime Cordial and Cocktail Lime specifically are still commonly used in Japanese cocktail bars, though increasingly I am seeing bartenders turn to fresh lime juice and sugar syrup instead. In America, the overly sugary nature of the ingredient has persuaded many bartenders to make their own versions, myself included. As a two-ingredient cocktail, the quality of the gin or vodka you choose can mean the difference between a good gimlet and a fantastic one, so I recommend something from Japan for the base.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["2 ounces Suntory Haku vodka or Nikka Coffey gin","¾ ounce Lime Cordial"],"steps":["In a shaker tin, combine the preferred spirit and lime cordial with ice.

In honor of these intoxicating blooms, I invented this cocktail using crème de violette for its floral qualities and amethyst hue. The juicy botanicals of gin surface when paired with yuzu-shu (see this page), and white rum interjects with subtle grass and vanilla.

Unlike American cream soda, kurīmu-sōda is a melon soda float with vanilla ice cream and a maraschino cherry on top. Every time I smell Midori I think about inventing elaborate concoctions with my brothers, as we would layer ingredients onto the basic formula of the kurīmu-sōda for a sugar-rich accent to our meal. In the cocktail world, Midori is perhaps best known for its namesake role in the Midori Sour. The cocktail—made with the liqueur, sour mix (or sometimes lemonade), and a maraschino cherry garnish—was invented at Studio 54 in New York City and remained quite popular in America through the 1970s and ’80s. In my modern version, bright notes of melon contrast with the herbaceous undertones of green tea shōchū, which brings structure and complexity to the drink. The green tea flavors, with subtle notes of passion fruit and unripe banana, enhance the Midori. With each sip, there’s a layer of bright fruit and a flavor similar to lemon curd that gives way to the earthy tea and barley. Playful and fun, and yet still decidedly adult, it is an elevated version of the disco classic.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["1½ ounces Mizu green tea shōchū (see Note)","1 ounce Midori melon liqueur","½ ounce fresh lemon juice","½ ounce fresh lime juice","½ ounce Simple Syrup","Splash of club soda, to top","Garnish: Melon ball"],"steps":["In a shaker tin, combine the green tea shōchū, Midori, lemon juice, lime juice, and simple syrup.

Cantaloupe and watermelon are cut into slices and eaten as a midday snack or at the end of a meal, and muskmelons—the epitome of luxury in Japan—dazzle with their wrinkly skin and sweet green flesh. For this cocktail inspired by the fresh seasonal fruits, a lightly cloudy saké called sasanigori sets a fruity foundation for the drink, while cachaça, a fresh-pressed sugarcane rum from Brazil, adds a savory green olive undercurrent. The melon juice, the star of the show, ties all the disparate flavors together and the drink is garnished with a salty olive and a crack of black pepper. Depending on the sweetness of the melon, I suggest adjusting the lime juice or simple syrup to taste. This might take some experimentation before landing on the right balance, but the general key is that if the drink tastes too sweet, you can increase the amount of lime juice. If it’s not sweet enough because you have a melon that doesn’t have a lot of natural sugar, increase the volume of simple syrup.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["1 ounce Shirakawago sasanigori junmai ginjō","½ ounce Novo Fogo cachaça","1½ ounces honeydew melon juice","½ ounce fresh lime juice","½ ounce Simple Syrup","Garnish: Olive and freshly cracked black pepper"],"steps":["In a shaker tin, combine the sasanigori, cachaça, melon juice, lime juice, and simple syrup with ice.

It came to the States shortly thereafter, and the drink subsequently found a home within the canon of cocktails beloved by Japanese bartenders. In the 1970s and ’80s, the original recipe took a detour in Japan when an oil crisis impacted the import of many goods, including limes. Lemons were the replacement. They were easier to find, and as bartenders realized how the citrus made for a less bitter version of its lime-based counterpart, many adopted the switch permanently. You will still see certain bars using lemon juice today. The following recipe is one I created for the menu at GreenRiver in Chicago. I use a split base of Plantation Barbados 5-Year rum and Rhum Clément Select Barrel agricole, with lime juice. I like the contrast between the lively, grassy notes of agricole and the opulence of the aged rum—together they lead to a daiquiri with a rich flavor profile, round mouthfeel, and snappy finish.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["1½ ounces Plantation Barbados 5-Year rum","½ ounce Rhum Clément Select Barrel agricole","¾ ounce fresh lime juice","½ ounce Rich Demerara Syrup"],"steps":["Combine the rum, rhum agricole, lime juice, and demerara syrup in a shaker tin and shake briskly with ice.

Japanese cocktail bars are not immune to the allure of the highball—at places like Bar Shake in Ginza, master bartender Masayuki Kodato takes every aspect of the cocktail into consideration to make his most perfect version. Made with one piece of cracked ice, a bottle of Wilkinson club soda, chilled Campari, and lemon juice, it is a drink for which people travel from far and wide to get a taste. My recipe pairs respect for the one made by Kodato-san with my admiration for the version served over crushed ice at the Camparino in Galleria bar in Milan. Chilling the Campari in the freezer numbs some of its bitterness, and as it melts, the orange notes of the elixir bloom. I don’t use an entire bottle of club soda in my version so the Campari can shine, but I do include Bar Shake’s citrus, as it sets the drink in an eternally summery profile.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["1½ ounces Campari, chilled in the freezer","1 lemon wedge (about ⅛ of a lemon)","4 ounces club soda, to top"],"steps":["Fill a chilled collins glass one-third of the way with pebble ice.

Unlike American sno-cones, kakigōri is sheared into super fine sheets that melt like snowflakes on the tongue. Piled high into small bowls, they are drizzled with flavored syrups like strawberry with condensed milk or matcha; and in specialty cafés they sometimes come decorated with adzuki beans and omochi (rice cake). In this Americano-inspired cocktail, cherry liqueur pays homage to one of the best kakigōri flavors and most prized ripe fruits of the season: cherries! Called sakuranbō, sweet cherries are a delicacy in Japan, as most sakura trees do not bear edible fruit. The ones that do have cherries lighter in color and tarter than their rich, inky American counterparts known as Bing cherries.

Finding myōga in America can be difficult, but I still wanted to pay homage to its flavors, so with the Kamakiri, named after the praying mantis, I have taken a classic ginger cocktail, the Moscow Mule, and intertwined its ginger spice with the fresh mint of a mojito.

In Japan, it is most common to find it made with just three ingredients (tequila, lime juice, and triple sec). This framework is often adjusted in America with the inclusion of simple syrup or agave nectar. I enjoy introducing a seasonal ingredient to the template, especially in the summertime when this cocktail is so craveable. I came up with this variation to capture the essence of fresh bell peppers, which share vegetal characteristics with awamori and tequila. You won’t always find margaritas on the rocks or frozen in Japanese bars—instead, bartenders usually serve them up with a salted rim—but I think the addition of ice makes this sunny version of the classic all the more enlivening.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["Maldon sea salt, to rim the glass","1 ounce Masahiro Shuzō Shimauta awamori","¾ ounce Tequila Fortaleza Blanco","¾ ounce fresh lime juice","¼ ounce Royal Combier Grande orange liqueur","½ ounce Bell Pepper Syrup"],"steps":["Prepare a rocks glass by salting half the rim; set aside.

Many a bartender has tinkered with the ratios and there is much debate over the drink’s original recipe. Some say it should be equal parts dry sherry and French vermouth with orange and aromatic bitters. Others insist the cocktail was intended to be 3:1 ratio of sherry to vermouth, partnered with a single dash of orange bitters. The result of the latter ratio is a texture that’s leaner, with more subdued herbaceous tones. I enjoy my Bamboo somewhere in the middle, favoring fino as the base with a dash of orange bitters and a barspoon of rich oloroso sherry for added gravity.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["1½ ounces Valdespino Inocente fino sherry","½ ounce Dolin Dry Vermouth de Chambéry","1 dash orange bitters","1 barspoon El Maestro Sierra 15-Year oloroso sherry","Garnish: Lemon peel, lemon twist"],"steps":["In a mixing glass, combine the fino sherry, dry vermouth, orange bitters, and oloroso sherry.

For my summer-friendly take on the recipe I use manzanilla sherry from the coastal region of Sanlúcar de Barrameda in Spain, which contributes a snappy green apple flavor that melds wonderfully with kyūri (cucumber). The Japanese cucumber is as adorable as the name itself with a marvelous “green” flavor and slight bitterness from the skins. To capture that vegetal sharpness, I muddle the flesh and skins together instead of peeling away the glossy covering. Génépi, a French alpine liqueur of wormwood akin to absinthe and Chartreuse, adds a hint of bitter chamomile to the equation and bridges the flavor gaps lingering between the fruity sherry, dry vermouth, and juicy cucumber. A brisk sipper for sweltering afternoons.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["5 cucumber slices (a scant ⅛ inch thick)","1½ ounces La Guita manzanilla sherry","1½ ounces Noilly Prat Original Dry vermouth","1 barspoon Guillaumette L’Authentique génépi","Garnish: Cucumber slices"],"steps":["Place the cucumber slices in the bottom of a mixing glass and press with a muddler just enough to crack the skin and extract some liquid.

The recipe first appears in Jerry Thomas’s How to Mix Drinks featuring a mix of brandy, orgeat, bitters, and lemon. In the book Imbibe!, cocktail historian David Wondrich says it’s one of the only recipes invented by Thomas himself, named to commemorate the time when the first Japanese legation visited New York in 1860. When made with top-notch ingredients, the cocktail offers a medley of fruit, nuts, and spices that align in a way that is unexpected and exciting. For my modern interpretation, I made a cashew orgeat spiced with toasted green cardamom and fragrant orange flower water. Using cashews instead of almonds lifts up the darker flavors of the Cognac and shaking instead of stirring the drink drives the cocktail into invigorating territory.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["2 ounces H by Hine VSOP Cognac","½ ounce Cashew Orgeat","2 dashes Angostura bitters","Garnish: Lemon peel"],"steps":["In a shaker tin, combine the Cognac, cashew orgeat, and bitters with ice.

For the signature version served at Kumiko I created a template that matches a fortified wine or apéritif with Japanese whisky. When we served our first guests in January 2019, the Highball No. 1 featured a 20-year-old oloroso sherry with Mars Iwai whisky. Distilled mostly from corn, with just a touch of barley and rye, and aged in former bourbon barrels, the whisky offers sweet grain notes alongside the rich oxidative character of the oloroso. This second version, the Ringo Highball, is all about the apple. I wanted to celebrate one of Japan’s most beloved fruits while making sure the whisky would remain the star of the drink, so I chose one of my favorite apéritifs, pommeau, as the apple element and Mars Iwai 45, a higher proof version of the standard Iwai, as the whisky. For an additional aromatic element, I drizzle Normandy apple eau de vie on the top before serving—the first sip sings with character as the salty bubbles tickle your senses. Once you get into the drink, there’s a wonderful baked apple flavor underneath. The combination tastes like a whisky highball, but with a dance of apple flavors just in time for autumn.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["1¼ ounces Mars Iwai 45 Japanese whisky, chilled in the freezer (see Note)","¾ ounce Rhine Hall La Normande pommeau","Club soda, to top","Garnish: 1 barspoon Christian Drouin “Blanche de Normandie” apple brandy"],"steps":["Place a highball ice prism in a highball glass.

In the autumn, my mom would make a grape pie that I think about to this day. In tribute to my favorite fall dessert, I concocted this youthful cocktail with an old soul.

A surprising number of green flavors come through from the fennel-like freshness of Peychaud’s bitters, making it the perfect drink for clinging to the end of summer. From there, a tickle of clove and nutmeg emerges from the rum and falernum, and the saké wraps everything together in a soft blanket of sweet rice.

To highlight the seasonal flavor, I created this Cosmopolitan-like refresher with sudachi liqueur along with grapefruit and lime.

It is also low-proof, so you can snuggle up with a full pot of tea and a bottle of shōchū for a prolonged and pleasant evening of sipping.

This could be because the original drink—equal parts gin, sweet vermouth, and Bénédictine with two dashes of Angostura bitters—is a glass of syrupy sweetness rich enough to irk even the most avid sweet tooth. Yet, if you consider the fact that most of Maeda’s recipes were intended to be served in very small cordial glasses instead of the larger coupes and cocktail glasses we use today, it makes more sense—it is intended to be finished quickly, at its very coldest, so it remains palatable. Maeda shakes the drink instead of stirring (as contemporary bartending technique would normally instruct) to aerate the cocktail and liven up the texture, which makes the overall experience less cloying. This drink would be great for fans of the Bijou, Hanky Panky, or Martinez cocktails.","author":"Yonekichi Maeda","ingredients":["⅓ ounce The Kyōto Distillery Ki No Bi Kyōto dry gin","⅓ ounce Cocchi Vermouth di Torino","⅓ ounce Bénédictine","2 dashes Angostura bitters","Garnish: Pickled rakkyō"],"steps":["In a shaker tin, combine the gin, sweet vermouth, Bénédictine, and Angostura bitters with ice.

Or, as in this cocktail, scoop the sweet flesh into your shaker and whip up a tasty treat! For this drink I use a soba (buckwheat) shōchū called Touge, which comes from Kitsukura Brewery in Nagano. Touge shares some of the honeyed notes of persimmon and has a vanilla-tinged buttery tone, which plays beautifully with saffron-scented Yellow Chartreuse.

For my personal variation I was inspired by the Perfect Manhattan, which uses both dry and sweet vermouth. I was first introduced to the cocktail in my early days as a bartender, while working for Cornell Catering. I was both taken aback and drawn in by the intensity with which a guest dictated how he wanted the cocktail made. This led me to research more fully classic cocktails and their iterations. To this day, some of my favorite drinks are those made “perfectly,” with a split of sweet and dry, or with a split-base spirit. Instead of French dry vermouth, however, I like to use Pineau des Charentes, which has an inherent fruitiness and noticeable acidity that cuts through the lavish texture of the sweet vermouth. From there, the minty alpine botanicals that define Amaro Bràulio stand in for the Angostura bitters, offering a novel layer of bitterness that evokes the flavors of fall in Italy. At the end of the day, it still tastes like a Manhattan, just with a few personal twists and turns in the flavor.","author":"Julia Momosé","ingredients":["1½ ounces High West Rendezvous rye whiskey","½ ounce Amaro Bràulio","½ ounce Pineau des Charentes","½ ounce Cocchi Vermouth di Torino","Garnish: Lemon peel"],"steps":["In a mixing glass, combine the rye whiskey, amaro, Pineau des Charentes, and sweet vermouth.

Inspired by those playful moments, I created this riff on the Paper Plane, a modern American classic invented by bartender Sam Ross featuring bourbon, Aperol, Amaro Nonino, and fresh lemon juice. I’ve always loved the cocktail for its precise play of warmth, bitterness, and brightness. To take that model in a distinctly more Japanese direction, I turned to Japanese whisky. Akashi whisky is made of almost all corn, so it serves as a great match for bourbon lovers, and in the drink its sweet grain qualities and hint of peat fit snugly with Cappelletti, the bright red bitter I use in place of Aperol. Made with a base of white wine instead of neutral grain spirit, there is a softness that melds perfectly with the oaky whisky.

With a perky rosy hue, the drink is a playful version of the normally stoic winter toddy—a provocative cocktail that oscillates between a somewhat medicinal bitterness and bountiful bouquets of citrus and spice.

It dovetails perfectly with the tartness of ruby red grapefruit.

In this variation I combine those elements together with hōjicha, which fans through the drink with a caramel, molasses, and freshly-roasted-coffee-like quality. I think about the story of this cocktail as the story of the seasons: how lively plants like sugarcane and tea start out fresh and green then shift to brown and dry in the winter—there is a beauty in the process because it showcases new and unexpected shades of the familiar ingredients as time goes by.

Banana and strawberry are common flavors, as is matcha. Hot matcha in the wintertime paired with milk becomes a hearty drink in modern-day Japanese cafés. I wanted to capture this feeling in a cocktail, but instead of dairy-based milk I reached for cashew milk, which I enjoy for its depth of nutty goodness.

I used to eat so many my hands would turn a deep orange color from all the snacking sessions. Other times, I’d save them for my favorite wintertime game. When heavy snow hit the mountains, we’d play in the deepest drifts, throwing mikans into fluffy banks of fresh powder and fishing them out the next day to eat frozen. The way the juicy segments snapped with frigid cold felt like tiny fireworks with each bite. To re-create that memory in a cocktail, I bury satsuma juice beneath a chilly layer of crushed ice and absinthe. As the absinthe seeps into the juice, it louches, creating a cloudy white layer that looks like snow. The first sip is bracingly cold, prickling waves of anisette, with relief from the satsuma juice below offering a sweet contrast.

Distilled from barley, black kōji, and freshly steamed green tea, this shōchū brings a distinctly “green” and chocolaty note to the traditional mix of crème de cacao, crème de menthe, and heavy cream. In Japan, most grasshopper cocktails take a spin through the blender with ice for a thick and creamy texture, but I prefer mine shaken because I like how much easier it is to drink without a straw or spoon.

To harness that personality in a festive holiday cocktail, I reached for strawberry liqueur and soba (buckwheat) shōchū, which has vanilla and almond notes that mirror those found in the sponge cake. A layer of sweet cacao–imbued cream pretends to be frosting, upon which we drizzle a drop of Peychaud’s bitters to serve as a visual reminder of the kiss of strawberries that grace the tops of cakes. Before you mix, notice the smaller proportions of this drink. Like the Line Cocktail (this page), this recipe falls into the category of short drinks—ones that are meant to be consumed in two or three light, fleeting sips.

Not every bar does this, but when they do it’s wonderful because it creates a completely different drinking experience.
