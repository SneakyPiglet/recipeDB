#Agave
  - name: Margarita
    notes: "While many, many tequila cocktails are worthy of the same kind of reverence as the margarita, we can thank this Latin American classic for putting agave on the classic-cocktail map. And that it certainly has done: the margarita is arguably one of the most popular drinks of all time, poured the world over. Unfortunately, like everything popular, it’s easily butchered. (I’m looking at you, sour mix and cheap tequila!) Some bartenders also like to put an insane  amount of booze in their margaritas—as in three full ounces of 40 percent ABV spirit. I make mine less powerful and more balanced because I personally like to have a few of them at one sitting, because…they’re delicious! Made right, the margarita is the perfect harmony of agave, lime, and triple sec (and when it comes to the latter, I find there is absolutely no substitute for Cointreau)."

    notes: If you get the chance, you must go to the churchlike shrine of Siete Leguas’s new distillery in Jalisco. Stained-glass windows bathe the entire space with a warm glow, while horses circle languidly around tahonas, and gorgeous copper stills reflect the light. It’s like a cathedral, an art museum, and a traditional distillery all in one, and it’s absolutely breathtaking. This drink, for me, is the one to drink in such a place. I love bubbles, and I love riffing on sparkling-wine drinks. There are a lot of them out there; probably the best known is the French 75, to which I pay homage here. This drink takes its lead from the blanco tequila of Siete Leguas, with its rich fruit; I decided to add a touch of bittersweet Salers Aperitif to combat the sweeter fruit flavors and tie into the sparkling wine for a little more dryness.
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 1 oz Siete Leguas Tequila Blanco
    - ¾ oz Salers Aperitif
    - ½ oz lemon juice
    - ½ oz Raspberry Syrup
    - ¼ oz Giffard Creme de Peche
    - 1 dash Regan’s Orange Bitters
    - 2 oz Raventós i Blanc de Nit Rosado Cava
    - Grapefruit twist for garnish
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the cava and grapefruit twist, to a cocktail shaker with ice. 
    - Shake and fine-strain into a coupe glass. Top with the cava. 
    - Express the grapefruit twist over the drink and then rest the twist on the rim.

    notes: Traditionally, this classic Mexican cocktail is made with grapefruit soda—generally Squirt. (I also like mine made with the zesty Jamaican Ting.) But freshness is key at Leyenda, so we like to do ours the natural way, with fresh juices. It’s a drink that really comes alive. Try it with mezcal, try it with jalapeño-infused tequila—it’s good with just about anything!
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 2 oz tequila of your choice
    - ¾ oz lime juice
    - ¾ oz grapefruit juice
    - ¾ oz Simple Syrup
    - Lime wheel for garnish
    - Salt for garnish
    - 1 oz club soda
    - Grapefruit wheel, halved, for garnish
    steps:
    - Add the tequila, both juices, and simple syrup to a cocktail shaker with ice. 
    - Wet the rim of a Collins glass with the lime wheel and roll in salt for a salt rim. 
    - Shake and strain over fresh ice into the glass. Top with the club soda. 
    - Garnish with the lime and grapefruit wheels.

    notes: On one infamous trip to Oaxaca, at one particular cantina, a group of us were playing dice in a corner when a man walked up to the bar, ordered a drink, and, when it came, suddenly headbutted the young bartender. He then left his drink on the bar and walked right out. The music didn’t even stop, and no one seemed to care or notice—except the bartender with his bloody nose. This drink, whose name means “headbutt,” is a tribute to that bizarre night.

  - name: Tia Mia
    notes: Being a mezcal lover, I went through a phase where I tried floating mezcal on top of all sorts of different drinks. This drink is the first cocktail I ever put on one of Julie Reiner’s menus when I worked at Lani Kai in 2010. It continues to remain a staple on the menu at Leyenda. I started by floating an ounce of mezcal on top of my Mai Tai and then swapped out the funky rhum agricole we used in our recipe there altogether  by replacing it with the smoky and equally funky mezcal. The result was the Tia Mia, whose name is an anagram of its namesake (the mai tai) and an homage to my friend Catherine, my Tia de Alma (“spiritual aunt,” i.e., close, but not related by blood), who was my bar regular when I bartended in Guatemala.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 oz Del Maguey Chichicapa Mezcal
    - 1 oz Appleton Reserve Rum
    - ½ oz Pierre Ferrand Orange Curaçao
    - ¾ oz lime juice
    - ½ oz Orgeat Works T’Orgeat Toasted Almond Syrup
    - Mint sprig for garnish
    - Lime wheel for garnish
    - Edible orchid for garnish (optional)
    steps:
    - Add the mezcal, rum, curaçao, lime juice, and orgeat to a cocktail shaker with ice. 
    - Shake briefly and strain over crushed or pebbled ice in a large rocks glass. 
    - Traditionally, we garnish this drink at Leyenda with a mint sprig, a lime wheel, and an edible orchid for fun flair, but if you can’t get your hands on an orchid, don’t worry! It’s only there to add a beautiful touch to the cocktail.

    author: Jesse Harris
    notes: Jesse Harris created this Leyenda classic as an homage to his home on the California coast, where eucalyptus trees line the beaches. The reposado tequila is given a punch-up with the higher-proof blanco tequila, providing the drink with a backbone to hold up the strong flavors within it. This one’s truly one of my all-time favorites.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 oz Tromba Reposado Tequila
    - ½ oz Tapatio 110 Tequila Blanco
    - ½ oz Giffard Crème de Banane

    - ¾ oz lemon juice
    - ½ oz Honey Syrup
    - ¼ oz maple syrup
    - 2 dashes Angostura Aromatic Bitters
    - Eucalyptus leaf for garnish
    - Banana chip for garnish
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the eucalyptus leaf and the banana chip, to a cocktail shaker with ice. 
    - Shake and strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice. 
    - Garnish with the eucalyptus leaf and the banana chip on a pick.

    author: Tom Macy  
    notes: Tom Macy, one of my business partners at Leyenda, created this drink. He was inspired by Del Maguey’s Santo Domingo de Albarradas mezcal, a rich and slightly bitter spirit with notes of super fruit and funk. Tom’s cocktail is structured almost like a Manhattan, with a blend of sherries in lieu of vermouth, Vida mezcal for backbone, a touch of Suze for bitterness, and banana liqueur for the fruit.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ oz Del Maguey Vida Mezcal
    - 1¼ oz Cesar Florido Fino Sherry
    - ¾ oz Cesar Florido Moscatel Sherry
    - ¼ oz Suze
    - 1 tsp Giffard Crème de Banane
    - Lime twist for garnish
    - 5 to 6 spritzes Del Maguey Santo Domingo de Albarradas Mezcal
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the lime twist and Santo Domingo de Albarradas mezcal, to a mixing glass with ice. 
    - Stir and strain into a rocks glass over a big ice cube. 
    - Express the oils of the lime twist over the glass and then place the twist between the cube and glass. 
    - Using an atomizer, spritz the Del Maguey Santo Domingo de Albarradas mezcal on top for aromatics.

    notes: Of all my favorite bars in the world, few compare to Pare de Sufrir (literally meaning, “Stop Suffering”) in Guadalaja, Mexico, owned by agave specialist Pedro Jimenez Gurría. When you walk into this space, you’re immediately greeted by the sight of hipster Mexican youth dancing and drinking beers and an array of awesome Mexican distillates, particularly from their own state of Jalisco. Apart from the choice spirits, the best part of this bar is the disco ball in the middle of the room, which, rather than being motor-operated, has to be spun with a broom handle by the busy bartenders to get it going. Whenever it stops spinning—which it does many times a night—chants rise up of “Bola! Bola!” (literally meaning, “[disco] ball, [disco] ball!”). This drink features a particularly excellent agave spirit made by a secretive indigenous population in the hills between Jalisco and Durango. It’s a rare treat, really to be consumed neat and alone, with unique notes of apples, nuts, and bright vinegar. In honor of Pare de Sufrir, I decided to mix it up, just this once.

    notes: Sotol’s unusual, aggressive flavor profile can be even trickier to use than mezcal, and it usually requires a little hand-holding on the part of the bartender to introduce properly. Leyenda’s head bartender, Shannon Ponche went out on a limb when she created this delicious cocktail, combating the vegetal asparagus notes of the sotol with a bit of tamarind liqueur to make this savory treat.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1½ oz Sotol Por Siempre
    - ¾ oz Von Humboldt’s Tamarind Cordial
    - ¼ oz Dolin Blanc Vermouth de Chambery
    - ¼ oz Orgeat Works T’Orgeat Toasted Almond Syrup
    - ¼ oz lemon juice
    - 3 drops Bittermans Orchard Street Celery Shrub
    - Celery leaf for garnish
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the celery leaf, to a mixing glass with ice. 
    - Stir and strain into a rocks glass over a big ice cube. 
    - Garnish with the celery leaf floating on the big cube.

    notes: Frequently in the cocktail world, drinks imitate drinks imitate drinks—and this one is an adaptation of an adaptation of the Negroni. I liked the higher-proof mesquite notes of this particular espadin mezcal, and I wanted to heighten its slight bitterness and fruit notes. I elected to use a blend of rums and Spanish vermouth to accomplish this. This funky, earthy, bitter sipper brings in different fruit notes and a sweetness out of this complex mezcal.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ oz Koch Espadin Mezcal
    - ½ oz Plantation Jamaican Rum
    - ½ oz Atxa Vino Vermouth Blanco
    - ½ oz Cynar

    notes: This beautiful drink was created by Jesse Harris at Leyenda. Siete Leguas tequila has sweet, earthy notes that play up the rhubarb and vanilla, and the Chartreuse mellows it while the cardamom brings the acid back up. There’s quite a bit of prep for this drink with the rhubarb syrup, but the result is worth it!
    glassware: pilsner
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ oz El Tesoro Tequila Blanco
    - ¼ oz Deniset-Klainguer Fraise des Bois
    - ½ oz Yellow Chartreuse
    - ¼ oz Vanilla Syrup
    - ¾ oz Rhubarb Syrup
    - ¾ oz lemon juice
    - ½ tsp Campari   
    - 2 drops Saline Tincture
    - Cucumber ribbon for garnish
    - 1 dash Cardamom Tincture
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the cucumber ribbon and cardamom tincture, to a cocktail shaker with ice. 
    - Spiral the cucumber ribbon inside a pilsner or large Collins glass and then add crushed or pebbled ice. 
    - Add the cardamom tincture on top for aromatics.

    notes: This is a great fall or winter slow-sipper that is rich and complex, celebrating the aged tequila and rich sherry. I created this drink to remember a particularly cool night I spent in the Tequila Valley, where we sipped reposado throughout “to keep warm.” The black-pepper notes of Partida tequila cut nicely into the nutty sweetness of the sherry, and the blackstrap rum acts as a bridge between them. Who says tequila is just a summer drink?

    notes: The drink’s name refers to the infamous wall that the forty-fifth president of the United States was so keen on building. With it, I took the classic Southside cocktail (made with gin and muddled mint and cucumber) and put a spin on it, using a little sherry to give nuance to the drink and help link the mezcal to the cucumber and jalapeño.
    glassware: highball
    ingredients:
    - 4 slices cucumber
    - ¾ oz El Jolgorio Espadin Mezcal
    - ¾ oz jalapeño-infused Siembra Valles Blanco Tequila

    - ¾ oz lime juice
    - ½ oz Agave Syrup
    - 1 dash Bittermans Orchard Street Celery Shrub
    - 1 oz soda water
    - Mint sprig for garnish
    steps:
    - Muddle 3 cucumber slices in a cocktail shaker. 
    - Add all the other ingredients, except the reserved cucumber slice, the soda water, and the mint, to a cocktail shaker with ice. 
    - Shake and fine-strain into a highball glass with fresh ice. 
    - Top with the soda water and garnish with the remaining cucumber slice with the mint sprig poked through the middle.

    notes: I wanted to make the perfect romantic-comedy homage in a drink—a little sweet, a little bitter, and HOT. The inspiration for the Say Anything, a great little summer sipper, came about when I was doing a new menu tasting with the staff at Leyenda. As I was miming the classic moment in the movie of the same name, where John Cusack holds the boombox over his head, I suddenly realized that none of the young staff knew what I was talking about. Oh, youth!

    notes: When making the road trip from the Tequila Valley to the highlands, I like to stop and get sweets to pair with the occasional taco, pulque, or nip of tequila. My favorite kind of sweet, if I can find them, are these spicy cherry lollipops sold by kids on the road, right next to their pulque-selling parents. I made this drink to remind me of those funky sour sweets and bring me back when I’m too far away!

    notes: "Pechuga mezcals are so full and vibrant that they practically beg to be made into drinks—though frequently their cost prohibits that. Here, I wanted to indulge and create a cocktail that played on their unique fruity and gamey flavors. Tosba Pechuga is made with a turkey breast hung above the distillation with lots of wild apples and pineapples—all of which are grown on the distillery’s beautiful property in the misty mountains of northern Oaxaca. The apple aperitif acts like a fortified wine in the drink, and the Monk’s liqueur, which has a fantastic churchlike incense taste to it, reinforces the mezcal’s light smoke. Keep in mind: this recipe requires a longer infusion, so prep time is needed!"

    notes: Mezcal can be a beast, and when it first came into popularity in the United States, that was a big part of its appeal. (So much smoke! So much flavor!) However, in drink making, sometimes too much is too much; and if you want to use mezcal as your base and not a modifier, it can easily drown out the rest of the drink. I created the Arinato to be a lighter stirred drink and to celebrate the more delicate sides of what many think of as a brutish spirit. The mezcal I use is the 80-proof Ilegal Joven; paired with floral fortified wines, it makes for an easy-sipper that proves how elegant mezcal can be.

    - 1½ oz Ilegal Mezcal Joven

    notes: On one trip to the La Alteña distillery years ago, we went to eat in my favorite carnitas spot, Carnitas Jaimes. (This is a MUST-stop if you ever make it up to the highlands of Jalisco! Not only is the food next level but mariachis serenade you while you eat and drink.) The drink of choice there is, obviously, tequila, which pairs awesomely with the pork and pickled carrots and serranos. This drink was conceptualized while we ate our weight in carnitas and drank tequila from the entire region. When I returned to Brooklyn, I created this drink, adding just a touch of crème de pineapple to the recipe to bring out some of the sweetness of the agave.

    notes: I have yet to visit Chihuahua’s own sotol distilleries, only ever having skirted around the Mexican state while driving in the south of Texas (and peering thirstily over the border). Luckily, Clande’s founder, Ricardo Pico, is a huge wealth of knowledge, and he is always happy to share random plastic bottles he’s brought back, educating me and others on this unusual, mossy-yet-minty drink. Here, I wanted to highlight the rich fruits but oddly pinesap-like quality of this spirit, which reminds me of nights along the border, wanting to go out and explore.

    notes: This is a drink created by the fantastically talented Shannon Ponche. She has mastered savory drinks better than anyone I know, and this refreshing, herbaceous cocktail is a great example. It’s a play on the Caipirinha that incorporates some mezcal for added complexity but avoids drowning out the other flavors with smoke.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 2 lime wedges
    - 5 sage leaves
    - ¾ oz Pineapple Syrup
    - 1½ oz Ilegal Mezcal Joven
    - ½ oz Novo Fogo Silver Cachaça
    - ½ oz lime juice
    - Seared pineapple wedge for garnish
    steps:
    - Add the lime wedges and 3 sage leaves to a cocktail shaker and muddle in the pineapple syrup. 
    - Add the spirits, lime juice, and ice. 
    - Shake hard and pour all the contents directly into a rocks glass. 
    - Garnish with the grilled pineapple wedge and remaining 2 sage leaves on a pick. (If you don’t want to grill the pineapple, that’s okay! But it makes for a nice look.)

    notes: While visiting the fantastic people at Rey Campero in Candelaria Yegolé, Oaxaca, we found ourselves running through rows of Madre cuishe agave at sunset, screaming “Karwinski!” (This is a particularly Dr. Seuss–esque family of agaves, to which Madre Cuishe belongs, that grow almost like a pineapple on a palm tree–like stalk; it’s not hard to pick out their silhouettes against the sky.) I’d like to say that was before the drinking started, but really no time was before the drinking started on that trip to the arid Oaxacan South. This drink is a riff on the White Russian—and its name, yes, is a Big Lebowski reference. Its flavors are meant to play up the fruit and light chocolate notes hiding behind the vegetal, split-wood greenness of the Madre Cuishe mezcal.

    notes: Alisha Neverson created this nice rich drink for Leyenda. The bourbon acts as a rich canvas to carry the slight smoke of the mezcal, which in turn gets a boost from the turmeric. The apricot liqueur used here is actually pretty bitter, pairing with the red-wine float and pepper to round everything out.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ oz Michter’s Bourbon Whiskey
    - ¾ oz Ilegal Mezcal Joven
    - ¾ oz lemon juice
    - ¾ oz Tumericane
    - ½ oz Luxardo Apricot Liqueur
    - ½ oz red wine (I suggest Grenache)
    - Freshly ground black pepper for garnish
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the wine and black pepper, to a cocktail shaker with ice. 
    - Shake and strain into a rocks glass over a big ice cube. 
    - Gently pour the red wine over the drink and finish with a light dusting of black pepper on top.

    notes: I have visited La Alteña distillery many times, starting with an epic trip for Tequila Ocho—which is made there—with co-founder Tomas Estes. Although Tomas is a foreigner, hailing from the United States and now living in London, he joined the multigenerational Camarena family at La Alteña to make his tequila; and on that first trip, I got to see the nuances of the distillery and, most important, their dedication to family and tradition. The family employs generations of different families at the distillery and in their agave fields; some stay their entire lives. On my last visit there, nearly a decade later, this time with El Tesora, I saw a man I’d met on that first trip. Too old now to do much physical labor anymore, he’s officially retired and comes into the distillery of his own accord to shine the stainless-steel holding tanks. This drink is for him.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 oz El Tesoro Añejo Tequila
    - ½ oz Knob Creek Rye Whiskey
    - ¼ oz Mace-Infused Tapatio 110 Tequila Blanco
    - ¼ oz Lustau Moscatel Sherry
    - ½ tsp Cinnamon Bark Syrup
    - 1 dash Regan’s Orange Bitters
    - Lemon twist for garnish
    - Orange twist for garnish
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the lemon and orange twists, to a mixing glass with ice. 
    - Stir and then strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube. 
    - Express the oils of the lemon and orange twists over the glass and then add the twists to the glass.

#Sugarcane
  - name: Mojito
    notes: When I was in Havana, I made a point of drinking a Mojito in every bar I went to. (The resulting fresh buzz I had while walking the picturesque city was fantastic!) But perhaps my favorite memory was when I was asked behind the bar at the famed Hotel Nacional to whip some up for a group of visiting cantineros. The bar was the favorite of many of the celebrity elite who visited during their heyday; pictures of Ernest Hemingway, Jimmy Carter, Ava Gardner, and more line the walls. It was like stepping back in time to make one of the world’s most iconic cocktails. This drink is some bartenders’ worst nightmare, especially when they’re busy, but it happens to be my guilty pleasure—beautiful, delicious, and refreshing. If you can’t get your hands on some Havana Club, try making it with either Banks or Plantation Three Stars rum.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 8 to 10 mint leaves
    - ¾ oz Simple Syrup
    - ¾ oz lime juice
    - 2 oz Havana Club 3 Rum (or Banks Rum or Plantation Thr    - Stars)
    - 1 oz club soda
    - Mint sprig for garnish
    steps:
    - Muddle the mint leaves and simple syrup in the bottom of a Collins glass. 
    - Add the lime juice and rum and fill half the glass with pebbled or crushed ice, being sure to keep the mint neatly on the bottom of the glass. 
    - Swizzle the ice lightly with a spoon until the glass gets nice and frosty. 
    - Add the club soda and top with fresh ice. 
    - Garnish with the mint sprig.

    notes: This is one of those cases in which (outside of Brazil, anyway) the cocktail is better known than the spirit in it. This Latin classic started as a medicine for the Spanish flu, and the original recipe contained cachaça, lime, honey…and garlic. At some point, some bright-minded person decided to remove the garlic and replace the honey with sugar, and the rest was a much more delicious history. You can get a version of this at just about every bar or restaurant. I like to give them a real hard shake to express more of the flavorful oils of the limes.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - ½ lime, cut into quarters
    - 1 tsp superfine sugar
    - 2 oz Novo Fogo Silver Cachaça
    steps:
    - Add the quartered half-lime and sugar to a cocktail shaker and muddle fiercely. 
    - Add ice and the cachaça. 
    - Shake hard and pour into a rocks glass. No garnish.

    notes: "The Mai Tai is one of the most fantastic—yet most bastardized—classic rum tiki drinks. Made famous by the iconic Trader Vic in 1944 (so the story goes) in his eponymous Oakland tiki haven, this drink, whose name means “the best” in Tahitian, can be seen today in bars and beach clubs from Honolulu to Cancún, in various forms far from the original concoction. One thing’s for sure: this recipe needs Jamaican rum. I took a note from my mentor and business partner, cocktail queen Julie Reiner, and added some Martinique rhum as well, to bring up the floral funkiness even further."
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 oz Appleton Reserve Jamaican Rum
    - ½ oz Smith & Cross Jamaican Rum
    - ½ oz Clement Rhum VSOP

    - Mint sprig for garnish
    - Lime wheel for garnish
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the sugarcane stick, orchid, mint sprig, and lime wheel, to a cocktail shaker with ice. 
    - Shake briefly and strain over crushed or pebbled ice in a large rocks glass. 
    - Traditionally, this is garnished with a sugarcane stick and an edible orchid, so feel free to include them if you’re feeling especially tropical. 
    - Otherwise, simply garnish with a mint sprig and lime wheel tucked inside the glass.

    notes: "This cocktail is an homage to a flat tire I got while trying to make it to the Appleton distillery in the center of the island of Jamaica. While Shannon Sturgis, the photographer for this book, and I were driving up and over mountains, following (idiotically) Google Maps, we ended up on the skinniest, most pockmarked “road” of all time. Driving white-knuckled around a blind corner (on the “wrong side” of the road, mind you!) I walloped a pothole and nearly sent us tumbling down the steep ravine of the tropical mountain. Of course, the spare tire with which Avis had supplied us was conveniently flat, so Shannon and I went on a two-hour drive with a very nice family through the Jamaican bush attempting to find a fix. Fortunately, we eventually did—buying the baldest tire I’ve ever seen from a man who made me write my own receipt on a page from a daily planner from 1967. This was the drink we were both craving toward the end. It’s inspired by Leyenda bartender Ryan Liloia’s riff on a tiki classic, the Jungle Bird: tall, tropical, slightly bitter, and refreshing."

    notes: St. Lucia has a unique colonial history. Being in line of sight both of French Martinique and the then-English Barbados, the island was fiercely fought over by the two powers when they were at war, and ultimately changed hands fourteen times between them before gaining its independence in 1979. The back-and-forth cultural influence of England and France is not only literally visible in St. Lucia today—the oldest buildings there are literally constructed in alternating French and English styles—but it’s also tasted in its approach to rum, which emphasizes experimentation and variety. One morning during a visit to St. Lucia, I woke up decently foggy after a night spent dancing and drinking horrific rum punches at their weekly Friday affair, the Jump Up. Groggily, I strolled down to the beach with SPIRIBAM’s Ben Jones, my guide on the trip, to take a dip in the beautiful ocean to wash away the cobwebs. From our idyllic swimming hole, Martinique was just in sight. This drink, incorporating a blend of St. Lucia and Martinique r(h)ums, commemorates that amazing morning and that interesting theory.

    notes: I adore piña coladas and could basically drink them all day, every day, any day. In making this variant, I wanted to amplify the basic recipe a little. Rather than using a light rum that doesn’t bring much to the fat of the coconut, I used a more flavorful cachaça. I also elected to ditch the pineapple and obtain my fruit notes from passion fruit instead.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 2 oz Avuá Prata Cachaça
    - ½ oz lime juice
    - ½ oz coconut milk
    - ¾ oz Vanilla Syrup
    - ¼ oz Cinnamon Bark Syrup
    - ¼ oz Passion Fruit Syrup
    - Freshly grated nutmeg for garnish
    - 2 pineapple fronds for garnish
    - Edible orchid for garnish (optional)
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the nutmeg, pineapple fronds, and orchid, to a blender with a cup of ice and blend until smooth and integrated. 
    - Pour into a tiki mug or Collins glass. 
    - Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg, the pineapple fronds, and orchid (if using) placed inside the glass.

    notes: This classic rhum cocktail was originally imbibed by fieldworkers in the French Caribbean to fortify them during the workday. Now, though, everyone in the French West Indies makes it in his or her own way, and everyone has opinions (and strong ones) about how it should be made. When I was in Martinique, I asked why there were so many different ways of making the classic drink. In response I was told the famous expression, Chacun prepare sa propre mort (“Everyone prepares his own death”)—and that was enough for me! Whether you use granular sugar or syrup, ice or none, aged or blanc rhum, the mixture is your very own, and up to you. I prefer mine with a little sugar and a little ice.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 2 lime discs (cut to have a little meat for juice but a lot of skin for bitterness)
    - 1 tsp Rhum J.M Cane Syrup
    - 2 oz Rhum J.M Blanc 55
    steps:
    - Express the lime discs into a rocks glass with a few pieces of hand-cracked ice and then add the syrup and rhum. 
    - Stir slightly to chill and integrate and serve.

    notes: The first drink I ever learned how to make was a Rum Popo, I made for my mother just as soon as she was comfortable letting me or my sister handle a knife. During that time, whenever we were on vacation, my mother would always get a few bottles of Appleton Rum (the good old stuff) for the house, and after a day of basic bliss on the beach (or wherever we were), she would ask one of us to run and make her a Popo. Essentially modeled after a Ti Punch; (not that Mama knew what that was), this simplest of drinks was named after her late dog—Malcolm X John Lennon, or Popo for short—who died before I was born. It goes to show that if the base spirit is good it takes very little to make it a cocktail.

    - 2 oz Appleton Estate 21 Year Old Jamaica Rum
    - 1 key lime, cut in half

    notes: When I set out to create this cocktail, I wanted to conceptually link the trade routes of the first colonial trips from the “Old World” to the “New World” and back again. What I ended up with (somewhat surprisingly) was a variation on the historic Flip cocktail, a drink whose recipe dates back to Prohibition and includes—yes—a whole egg. This eggnog-reminiscent cocktail is an after-dinner drink, to be sure. A rich decadent affair.
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:

    - ½ oz Cane Syrup
    - 4 dashes House Aromatic Bitters
    - Freshly grated nutmeg for garnish
    - 3 coffee beans
    steps:
    - Crack the egg into a cocktail shaker and discard the shell. 
    - Add all other ingredients, except the nutmeg and coffee beans, to the shaker and dry shake to emulsify the egg. 
    - Add ice, shake, and fine-strain into a coupe glass.

    notes: Jamaica is a truly beautiful island that holds so much more than the all-inclusive resorts of Negril and Montego Bay would suggest. In my youth, practically the only place I ever experienced besides Vermont’s Green Mountains were the Blue Mountains on the northeast coast of Jamaica in the Portland Parish, far from cruise ships and their crisply sunburned patrons. My parents, who worked all year, would escape there with my twin sister and me for weeks at a time when we were little, adding up to years of my life spent there. Lena, the woman who helped raise us, gave me some of my first foods from this tropical island, including guava. This tiki-inspired drink takes its inspiration from the tropical notes that aging spirits draw out of barrels. Bourbon plays nicely with the brandy and the light funk and richness of the Jamaican rum. It’s the guava, though, that ties the rum together with the other ingredients.
    glassware: pilsner
    ingredients:
    - ¾ oz Elijah Craig Bourbon Whiskey
    - ¾ oz Lustau Solera Reserva Brandy
    - ½ oz Coruba Jamaica Rum
    - ½ oz lemon juice
    - ½ oz Guava Syrup
    - ¾ oz Donn’s Mix
    - 5 to 6 dashes Peychaud’s Bitters
    - Mint sprig for garnish
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the bitters and the mint sprig, to a cocktail shaker with ice. 
    - Shake briefly and strain over crushed or pebbled ice in a pilsner glass or Collins glass. 
    - Float the bitters on top and garnish with the mint sprig.

    notes: Camper English, a cocktail writer hailing from San Francisco, came into the bar I was working at one day about a decade ago and requested something “stirred and murky.” My head went right to rum, along with a few of the other densest flavors I could think of. Rum is very traditionally blended. Some buy rum the world over from different distilleries, do a little rum mixology, and bottle the resulting liquid as new, no heavy lifting of fermenting or distilling at all. I like to achieve that in cocktails by blending my own. With this resulting Stir Key cocktail, the funkiness of the Jamaican Smith & Cross gets muddied (in a good way!) by the rich blackstrap and Gosling’s rum. The orange twist brightens it up just enough.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 oz Smith & Cross Jamaica Rum
    - ½ oz Gosling’s Rum

    notes: This cocktail started as yet another Negroni variation, but ended up something very much its own thing and a staple for us at Leyenda. The cachaça I selected here is a blend of an unaged silver with a touch of European oak, which lends itself well to the bitter sweetness of the Campari. The dry vermouth carries the apricot eau de vie to bring out the cachaça’s rich fruit even further, and the pamplemousse liqueur comes in to link everything back to the citrus of the Campari.

    notes: This one’s a watermelon daiquiri with a kick. I decided to use a rhum agricole from the French West Indies isle of Guadaloupe to bring some proof and slightly vegetal and mineral notes to the watermelon syrup I used. The wine-based Italian bitter serves as a period at the end of the drink. Damoiseau is a classic bottle seen on back bars of local watering holes lining the beautiful beaches of Guadeloupe. As in much of the West Indies, like Wray and Nephew in Jamaica, high proof runs the show. When we finally got it in the States, I was thrilled to use the Guadeloupen classic in this crushable sipper.
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 1½ oz Damoiseau Rhum Agricole 110 proof

    notes: Charanda is a sugarcane aguardiente, hailing from the lush microclimate in Michoacan, Mexico. As it turns out, the land of some of Mexico’s greatest mezcales has some great terrain for sugarcane, too! The name of Uruapan, the city from which charanda hails, essentially means “the land of eternal spring” or “where the trees are always flowering” in the area’s native language, and that’s exactly what it is. This quaint city is a far cry from the vast sandy deserts of the north, and it is nestled next to the Cupatitzio River, whose abundant swimming holes are perfect places to sip this awesome spirit, if you get a chance. Charanda is made from fresh sugarcane juice, so it has some of that residual oily funk and full fall-fruit notes that you find in some cachaças and rhum agricoles. Here, I wanted to let the rum stand up for itself, so I used the mango brandy to highlight its fruit notes and the carrot to emphasize its slight funk and earthiness.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1½ oz Uruapan Charanda Mexican Aguardiente

    notes: This drink was inspired by a trip to Brazil where I got to do a deep dive into the various local woods used for aging cachaça. I went to the incredibly quaint but (to me) rather bizarre town of Ivoti in Rio Grande do Sul. This town, populated almost entirely by German descendants, looks more like Bavaria than what you might think of as Brazil. Brazil is a massive and wonderfully diverse country; and this town with its German-speaking, blond Brazilians is just an example! In Ivoti, unsurprisingly, they bring a German precision to their cachaça. While there, I visited the distillery of Weber Haus, home of Yaguarsa Cachaça and, after trying some amazing cachaça aged in balsam wood, I decided I would try to make an amplified Caipirinha with it back at home.

    - ½ oz pineapple juice
    - 4 to 5 spritzes Sandalwood Tincture
    steps:
    - Muddle the lime quarters in the cane syrup in a cocktail shaker. 
    - Add the cachaça and Aperol, shake hard, and pour with the pineapple juice into a rocks glass (no ice).

This is a real celebration of bourbon, but in an unconventional tiki/Leyenda-esque way.

    notes: I first became interested in working with wood flavors after a visit to my favorite spot in Shoreditch, London, Sager + Wilde. They had two wood-flavored drinks on the menu, one of which (flavored with cedar) I completely fell in love with. The aromatics reminded me of the time in my late teens and early twenties living throughout Guatemala and other parts of Latin America, I developed a very strong interest in Catholicism and spent many hours in churches there. I’d come to appreciate the smell of cathedrals in particular—of musty incense, carved wood, and old books—and I wanted to create a drink inspired by that smell. Taking sandalwood as my starting point, I went down through its distinct tasting notes and put together a group of other ingredients that supported those flavors.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - ¾ oz Rittenhouse Rye Whiskey
    - ¾ oz Plantation Pineapple Rum
    - ½ oz Novo Fogo Barrel-Aged Cachaça
    - ½ oz Contratto Bitter Liqueur

    steps:
    - Combine all the ingredients, except the sandalwood tincture and lemon twist, in a mixing glass with ice and then stir. 
    - Spritz the inside of a chilled rocks glass with the tincture. 
    - Strain the cocktail into the spritzed glass (with no ice, sazerac style). 
    - Express the oils of the lemon twist over the glass and then discard the twist.

    notes: Bartender Amanda de la Nuez created this drink at Leyenda, combining her love of whiskey with her love of rum. The bright rye gives a little backbone to the English-style rum, and the heavy pot-stilled Jamaican rum lends it back some wonderful body. This Old Fashioned–like drink is rich and complex.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 oz Rittenhouse Rye Whiskey
    - ¾ oz El Dorado 12-Year Old Rum
    - ¼ oz Smith & Cross Rum
    - ¼ oz Tempus Fugit Crème de Cacao
    - 1 dash Dale DeGroff’s Pimento Aromatic Bitters
    - 1 dash House Orange Bitters
    - 4 to 5 spritzes Fernet Branca
    - Orange twist for garnish
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the Fernet Branca and the orange twist, to a mixing glass with ice and stir. 
    - Strain over a large ice cube in a rocks glass and add the Fernet Branca on top. 
    - Express the oils of the orange twist over the glass and place the twist inside the glass.

    notes: This drink was actually inspired by my trips to Spain, in particular to the south, where one can sit in a terraza for hours, alternately sipping sangria and espressos. This autumnal sangria-like pitcher is meant to be made in a big batch, from which guests are invited to serve themselves. To make it more Leyenda-esque, I chose to use an Argentinian Malbec and gave it some fortification and character with two different Jamaican rums. It’s slightly funky, with a little chocolate hint playing against the allspice. Serves 4 to 5.
    glassware: pitcher
    ingredients:
    - 10 oz Malbec red wine

    - ¾ oz St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram
    - 2½ oz maple syrup
    - 2½ oz lemon juice
    - 3¾ oz orange juice
    - 4 lemon wheels for garnish
    - 4 orange quarters for garnish
    steps:
    - Have an appropriate number of small glasses with ice ready for pouring.
    - Add all the ingredients, except the lemon wheels and orange quarters, to a pitcher with ice.
    - Stir to dilute.
    - Garnish the glasses (and pitcher) with the lemon wheels and orange quarters.

    notes: Shortly after Leyenda opened, our friend David Wondrich, noted cocktail historian, came in with his wife, Karen, for a drink and a hello. I was behind the bar and upon hearing that Dave wanted, “You know, whatever,” I decided to go to one of his all-time favorites, the New York Sour from when I worked across the street at the Clover Club. I reworked it Leyenda-style. Dave named the resulting drink himself, after the defunct airline on which he’d once traveled the Americas.

    notes: Rarely, I think, does a drink come along that’s at once so simple and so celebratory of the spirit around which it’s made. Jesse Harris created this drink out of love for Plantation Pineapple Rum, and it shows. This rum has a cult following within the cocktail community and seems to make something delicious out of anything and everything it is added to—but what about when it’s the star of the show? With just a little highly funky Jamaican rum to up the rummy-ness and some acid from the verjus, this cocktail drinks as though a pineapple daiquiri and a Manhattan had a baby together.

    notes: I think clairin is one of the most interesting spirits out there, and my trip spent driving the expanse of Haiti and visiting the diversity of people and cultures there was so vibrant and unusual, I still fall back on it as the source of many cocktail inspirations. The country really does make a spirit as expressive and unique as its people. The Sajous clairin I use here tastes simultaneously of grass and green mango, and I pair it with the acidity of the apple juice, using some pommeau for more richness and cardamom and saline to bring back the tartness of the apple skins.

    - Shake and strain into a Collins glass.

    notes: When I opened Leyenda, I became obsessed with Coca-Cola and the history behind it after hearing an NPR special. Latin America (led by Mexico) consumes more of the stuff than any other region on the planet, and it’s mixed with just about every alcohol consumed there to make a quick cocktail. The most popular of these mixtures is the Cuba Libre. This drink came to be in Cuba after the Spanish-American war, when Coca-Cola came in swinging to make money there. For this drink, I teamed up with tiki genius and rum mastermind Jelani Johnson to create our own Kola Syrup—a process that took far more research and development than any other drink on our menu, totaling more than 21 hours. We subbed out the original recipe’s classic cocaine for a slightly more legal mate reduction to complement the kola nut. You can use it in the Cuba Libre, in a Chilean Piscola, in Argentina’s famous Fernet and Coke, a Batanga with tequila, and so on. It’s labor intensive, but worth it! I was thrilled Jelani agreed to share this work.

    author: Ivy Mix
    notes: Morris’s Bar, opened in 1916 in Lima, Peru, by American expat Victor Morris, solidified pisco’s place within the world of classic cocktails with the Pisco Sour, for which Morris is credited as inventor. Morris died in 1939, at which point his many bartenders spread around the world, carrying the Pisco Sour and other great drinks with them. At our current moment in history, the Pisco Sour is what keeps pisco on the map. This version is my own, using lemon and lime juice to attempt to mimic the flavor of the small, acidic limes of South America.
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 2 oz BarSol Acholado Peruvian Pisco
    - ½ oz lemon juice
    - ½ oz lime juice
    - ¾ oz Simple Syrup
    - ½ oz egg white
    - 4 drops Angostura Aromatic Bitters
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the Angostura Aromatic Bitters, to a cocktail shaker. 
    - Dry shake without ice to emulsify the egg white. 
    - Add ice, shake, and strain into a coupe glass. 
    - Garnish by dropping the bitters on top.

    notes: "When I first heard of singani, I was thrilled to use it before I even tasted it. I was like, Aha! Bolivia—another Latin country to represent at the bar! Upon tasting it, however, I knew it would be a tricky component to work with, requiring some heavy-hitting complementary flavors to combat its heavily floral notes. Making singani drinks with other floral flavors just doesn’t work: you need something for it to butt up against. After all, unity sometimes only comes through conflict! For this drink, I decided to infuse the singani with tannic gunpowder green tea, to bite through the fat of the coconut and sweetness of the vanilla. The Mexican Fernet Vallet liqueur is rich and dark, and when mixed into the drink, it enhances the tannic tea to dry things out a little further."

    notes: With pisco I usually think light, citrusy, and bright, but here I took the opposite approach to make a darker sipper. Using the Torontel pisco with its rich jasmine notes as my starting point, I use the age and sweetness of the pineapple rum to bridge to the proof, dryness, and spiciness of the rye whiskey. The Palo Cortado sherry and just a few dashes of highly potent Jamaican rum make this a contemplative, Manhattan-like drink.

    notes: One evening in Peru, while I was driving through Ica after a long, cloudy day of rare rainfall in the arid desert vineyards, the clouds finally cleared to reveal some of the crispest, brightest stars that I’ve ever seen. On the opposite side of the world from where I was born in Vermont, I felt somehow at home. Yes, I’d lived momentarily in Peru when I was in college—but I’d never felt at home there. Now, on the other hand, I felt tranquil…totally at peace. Pisces is the sign in the zodiac that embodies the opposite, balancing energies underlying the world. Via the stars and my feeling of balance in Ica, this drink represents that centering experience for me.

    notes: When I lived in Argentina, I adopted the habit of drinking yerba mate out of the traditional dried gourd with the filtered straw. I would drink it, religiously, throughout the day. Years later I returned for the first time, this time working in the cocktail world and visiting every bar I could. I was particularly struck by a mate cocktail I tried at one of them that contrasted the tea leaves’ bitterness against a sweet punch. This cocktail builds on the simplicity of a Pisco Sour but incorporates mate for some added tannins. The result, I like to think, is pan-Latin in feel.

    notes: "San Isidro is the patron saint of agriculture in Catholicism. Though campesinos (farmers) the world over pray to this particular saint, never had I seen such devotion to him as in the Ica Valley in Peru. I was raised in a spiritual but relatively agnostic household, and in my first journeys across Latin America, I was struck by the power of the Catholic Church: both its history of brutality in the name of God and also the current status of an entire continent arguably more dedicated than Europe is today to this faith. My first time living in Peru, I was volunteering teaching kindergarten and had to take a series of buses to get from Cuzco out of town, and every time we passed a church—there were literally dozens—everyone on every bus crossed themselves. It amazed me that it didn’t matter how poor or how rich, how light-skinned or dark-skinned the people were—Catholicism tied them together. To me, bars are the only other thing that can come close to having that kind of unifying power. This drink is a celebration of that."

It was cause for celebration, and we danced, sang, and drank the day away in honor of the harvest and its rewards. This drink is a fall-time sour, celebrating the fruits of harvest and the opportunities it can bring.

A couple of dashes of absinthe highlight the vegetal character even more.

As a winemaker, he brings a unique vision to spirits making, and even as an expatriate, he shows massive pride in the national spirit of Bolivia. “This spirit is the heart of these high mountains,” he told me. “There’s a pride in what we make, because it’s what these people are. That’s the point.”

One way Shannon Ponche and I try to combat that at Leyenda is with a house-fermented tepache, made from the residual skins and pulp of the pineapples we juice. The tepache can be enjoyed on its own as a slightly fermented but essentially nonalcoholic beverage, or enjoyed in this drink, which can easily be made larger to serve big groups. Keep in mind that since tepache is a fermented beverage and takes a few days to ferment, it has to be made in advance."

    notes: "Believe it or not, Peruvians were drinking pisco mules in the 1800s, long before Moscow was given its own claim to fame. This drink (pictured opposite)—called the Chilcano—is now having a revival in Peru, and it is consumed in such quantities that a new verb has been coined: chilcaniar, or “to chilcano.” Its Bolivian cousin, the Choofly, is in effect a Singani mule. Though the drink is usually made with ginger ale or ginger beer, I decided to spice mine up with our own ginger syrup, and took the liberty of adding richness with some strawberry."
    glassware: highball
    ingredients:
    - ½ strawberry
    - 2 oz BarSol Quebranta Peruvian Pisco (or Singani 63 for a Choofly)
    - ¾ oz Ginger Syrup
    - ¾ oz lime juice
    - 1 oz club soda
    - Lime wheel for garnish
    - Candied ginger for garnish
    steps:
    - Muddle the strawberry in a cocktail shaker. 
    - Add all the remaining ingredients, except the club soda, the lime wheel, and the candied ginger, to the cocktail shaker with ice. 
    - Shake and fine-strain into a highball glass over fresh ice. 
    - Top with the club soda and garnish with the lime wheel and candied ginger skewered together on a cocktail pick.

    notes: This recipe is Julie Reiner’s rendition of the classic San Francisco gold-rush cocktail. While the real recipe is up for debate (as is known in the industry, the original recipe was a secret and taken to the grave), it is generally assumed that the drink contains pisco (duh), citrus of one kind or another, pineapple, and spices of some sort. I decided to make mine with an acholado pisco—as I believe most piscos traveling around during the late eighteenth century probably were.

    - 2 oz Capurro Acholado Peruvian Pisco
    - 1 oz pineapple juice
    - ¾ oz lemon juice

    - 2 dashes Fee Brothers Old Fashion Aromatic Bitters
    - 4 whole cloves

    notes: "This drink was created by Leanne Favre, and it takes a vegetal approach to a floral Chilean pisco. The result is a fantastic, colorful drink that does an excellent job of looking like it tastes: sweet-and-spicy, grassy, with bright floral notes."
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 1½ oz El Gobernador Chilean Pisco
    - ½ oz Arette Blanco Tequila
    - ¾ oz lime juice
    - ¾ oz pineapple juice
    - ½ oz Jalapeño Syrup
    - ¼ oz egg white
    - 2 dashes Bitter Truth Celery Bitters
    - Edible orchid for garnish (optional)
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except for the orchid, to a cocktail shaker. 
    - Dry shake without ice to emulsify the egg white. 
    - Add ice, shake, and strain into a coupe glass. 
    - If you can get an edible orchid, garnish the rim of the glass with it. (I love the bright pink of the orchid against the bright green, but it’s only decoration, so if you can’t get it, don’t fret.)

    notes: "When I lived in Peru for a short stint in college, we drank a bright-red, sweet cola called Kola Inglesa with pisco whenever we went out. It was certainly a college student’s sugary hangover delight—but when I started to dive deeper into cocktail creation, I remembered it fondly and made up this fancier version. It really only resembles the Kola Inglesa in its red appearance, as the bitterness of the Campari gives it a different flavor altogether: fresher and more nuanced."

    notes: "Yeah, I did it: I put Chilean and Peruvian piscos in a drink…together! Really, I wanted to play around with doing my own acholado-style pisco, blending the two countries’ spirits to create a nice background to build upon. Taking a martini as my inspiration, I replaced the usual vermouth with a manzanilla sherry, given a little weight by olive-leaf liqueur; it represents the offering of an olive branch between the two countries."

    - 1 dash Saline Tincture
    - 1 dash House Orange Bitters

    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients, except the caper berry, to a mixing glass with ice. 
    - Stir and strain into a rocks glass with one large ice cube.

    notes: "When we were in the build-out stage at Leyenda, I had the idea of using church pews for seating in our back area. (Really, calling it an idea isn’t putting it quite strongly enough; I was pretty much dead-set on it.) At first, of course, we couldn’t find any—and then, magically, we found four just down the street at a reused building-supply store. The magic continued into the build-out, when we somehow gained a fifth pew. It was unaccounted for when we picked up the others: nobody has any idea how we got it or where it came from. This drink is an homage to that magical appearance."
