#Aperitifs
  - name: Aperol Spritz
    author: 
    notes: The light and fizzy Spritz is a traditional Italian cocktail. It was typically enjoyed by older men playing cards in outdoor cafes. Here, we use Aperol, a gentle Italian aperitif with an alcohol content of 11 percent and a bittersweet flavor that comes from a careful balance of herbs, roots, bitter orange, and rhubarb. Brut Prosecco provides great acidity and a clean finish. Originally the Spritz was served in a wineglass, but at Employees Only we serve it tall to retain and concentrate the bubbles.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 4½ ounces brut Prosecco
    - 2½ ounces Aperol
    - 1 lime wheel, for garnish
    - 1 ounce club soda
    steps:
    - Fill a Collins glass with ice. 
    - Pour the Prosecco over the large cold ice cubes. 
    - Add the Aperol and lime wheel and top off with the club soda.

  - name: Campari Spritz
    author: 
    notes: The Campari Spritz is the predecessor of the Aperol Spritz. Whereas the Aperol version is soft, the Campari version is bold and assertive, so it is served in a smaller rocks glass and garnished with one large green olive. With its robust nature, the Campari Spritz is a very popular aperitivo alongside various antipasti containing olive oil, spices, fresh mozzarella, and seafood such as octopus, calamari, and clams.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces brut Prosecco
    - 1 ounce club soda
    - 2 ounces Campari
    - 1 large green olive, for garnish
    steps:
    - Build the cocktail carefully in a rocks glass over large cold ice cubes by first pouring the Prosecco. 
    - Add the club soda and finish with the Campari. 
    - Stir gently and garnish with the olive.

  - name: Elderflower Spritz
    author: 
    notes: The Elderflower Spritz is EO’s version of the St-Germain cocktail invented by Robert Cooper, the creator of St-Germain liqueur. The difference is that we add lemon slices for citrus in the middle. Our recipe was developed as a French version of the Italian Spritz, to offer to guests who dislike the bitterness of Aperol. Its flowery essence is calming and soothing, with a welcome simplicity.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 4 ounces Perrier-Jouët Grand Brut champagne
    - 2 ounces club soda
    - 3 thinly sliced lemon wheels
    - 2 ounces St-Germain elderflower liqueur
    steps:
    - Fill a large wine goblet with ice. 
    - Carefully pour the champagne over the large cold ice cubes, followed by the St-Germain, and finish with the club soda. 
    - Add the lemon wheels and stir slightly.

  - name: Fernando
    author: 
    notes: This original EO aperitif pays tribute to Italian gastronomy. Its main ingredient, Fernet Branca–made of overly bitter barks, herbs, and spices–is traditionally served as a digestive, but it is rarely used in cocktails because it tends to overpower all other ingredients. Fernet is purported to be a cure-all for many ailments–upset stomachs, menstrual cramps, baby colic, even cholera. It is an acquired taste, which makes it the favorite shot of bartenders who gravitate toward flavors rejected by the general public. The Fernando is rich and chocolaty, slightly sweet, with a bitter finish. To complete the cocktail, the bartender smacks a fresh mint sprig in the palm of the hand to release the essential mint oils. This cocktail is ideal for Negroni drinkers and diehard fans of Fernet alike.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ ounces Fernet Branca
    - 1¾ ounces Cinzano Bianco vermouth
    - ¾ ounce Liquore Galliano
    - 1 mint sprig, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour all the liquid ingredients into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and stir for 40 revolutions. 
    - Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. 
    - Place the fresh mint sprig in the palm of your hand and smack it with your other hand to release the aroma. 
    - Gently place the mint on the surface of the cocktail and serve.

  - name: Manhattan
    author: 
    notes: The Manhattan cocktail we serve is not to be confused with the contemporary Manhattan. This recipe first appeared in the latter part of the nineteenth century and is referenced in later editions of  How to Mix Drinks or the Bon Vivant’s Companion as well as Harry Johnson’s 1882 Bartenders’ Manual. This forgotten formula has a higher ratio of sweet vermouth to rye whiskey, with an accent of orange Curaçao and Boker’s bitters, served straight up with a lemon twist. Cherries in Manhattans came later as the mixture evolved into a different cocktail. The subtle mingling of flavors in this version illustrates an older style of drink making. Of course, as with any epic cocktail, there are several conflicting stories about its origins. Our favorite version has Winston Churchill’s mother, Jennie, ordering its creation for the celebration of Samuel Tilden’s election as governor of New York at the Manhattan Club. As exciting as this may sound, it seems that little Winston had more to do with disproving the theory. At the time of the election, Lady Churchill was in England giving birth to Winston, and the only noted celebration for Tilden actually coincided with the day of Winston Churchill’s christening.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Rittenhouse 100-proof rye whiskey
    - 1¾ ounces Dolin Rouge sweet vermouth
    - ½ ounce Grand Marnier
    - 3 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 1 lemon twist, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour the whiskey, vermouth, liqueur, and bitters into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and stir for 40 revolutions. 
    - Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with the lemon twist.

  - name: Contemporary Manhattan
    author: 
    notes: Most people today understand a Manhattan to be bourbon whiskey with a dash of vermouth, shaken or stirred–little more than a nice way to order a big shot of whiskey. Only recently have people once again acknowledged the necessity of bitters in the recipe. What happened? Prohibition all but annihilated rye whiskey production in this country; by the end of World War II, America had embraced Canadian whiskies as rye, even though most are made of a blend of grains. When we first began bartending, it was common for Manhattans to be made with Seagram’s VO or Crown Royal. But in the early 1990s, bartenders making Manhattans gravitated toward newly released single-barrel and small-batch bourbons to meet the expectations of the luxury crowd. As with Martinis, these customers demanded only a whisper of vermouth so as not to destroy the precious whiskey. Our recipe is an excellent expression of a Manhattan made with soft-natured bourbon. Rye whiskey makes a sharp, racy alternative. As for cherries, keep clear of the big artificial ones floating in eerie red dye. Pit fresh cherries and soak them for a few days in amaretto or cherry liqueur instead.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 3 ounces Woodford Reserve 90-proof bourbon
    - 1½ ounces Dolin Rouge sweet vermouth
    - 3 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 3 brandied cherries, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour the bourbon, vermouth, and bitters into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and stir for 40 revolutions. 
    - Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with the cherries.

  - name: Martinez
    author: 
    notes: In the mythology of classic mixology, the Martinez is purported to be the predecessor to the Dry Gin Martini. When we researched the original version of this cocktail, though, we saw very little resemblance to what people today refer to as a Martini. In an act of artistic interpretation, we devised a recipe to be the “missing link” to articulate the evolution of these two iconic cocktails. In doing so, we created a more dry–and more exciting–flavor profile than that of the original Martinez. Our missing link provides an experience with a beginning, middle, and finish that lingers, leaving you craving more. This is best achieved with the combination of Beefeater 24 gin, accents of maraschino liqueur, and the super velvetiness of Dolin Blanc vermouth. Finally, our own homemade Absinthe Bitters round it out and add incredible depth. This drink has been offered on our aperitif menu since we opened Employees Only. It goes great with raw oysters or raw bar of any kind and works well with summery salads and seared scallops.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2½ ounces Beefeater 24 gin
    - ½ ounce Luxardo maraschino liqueur
    - ¾ ounce Dolin Blanc vermouth
    - ¼ ounce Absinthe Bitters
    - 1 lemon twist, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour all the liquid ingredients into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and stir for 40 revolutions. 
    - Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

    author: 
    notes: "Whether or not this drink is truly an ancestor of today’s Dry Gin Martini (with which it has little in common), it is a great model in the cocktail fossil record because it showcases how certain ingredients were used before the twentieth century: back in the day, maraschino liqueur and orange Curaçao were two cordials used interchangeably (depending on availability) as sweeteners in cocktails. Vermouth was always sweet Italian red vermouth; French or dry vermouth were not popular in cocktail making until the end of the nineteenth century. Legend says this drink was named for the small Northern California town where a Gold Rush miner ordered “one for the road” before heading for the hills."

  - name: Nerina
    author: 
    notes: This EO original aperitif was inspired by the Negroni cocktail. It is a great example of how elegant and complex three liquids blended in a cocktail can be. Its rich flavors come from amaro, which we use in place of Campari, and Punt e Mes, in place of traditional sweet vermouth. Amaro is a bitter Italian digest if made from herbs and plants; for the Nerina, we prefer Meletti amaro, which has a beautiful spice profile with lingering notes of cinnamon, but is light on caramel compared to other amaros. Punt e Mes is a highly bittersweet aromatized wine, considered by some to be the original of Italian vermouth. Combined and blended with gin, the ingredients create a cocktail of simple sophistication. The name is a nod to the classic Negroni cocktail. Being a dark-hued drink, Nerina comes from nera, the feminine Italian word for black.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ ounces Plymouth gin
    - 1¼ ounces Meletti amaro
    - 1¼ ounces Punt e Mes sweet vermouth
    - 1 orange twist, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour all the liquid ingredients into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and stir for 40 revolutions.

  - name: Negroni
    author: 
    notes: The Negroni is the favorite classic cocktail of the EO bar staff. It is said that every bartender eventually has an affair with the Negroni. It is the Mrs. Robinson of cocktails–stunning, sexy, and mature. Its dark, alluring color is only a preview for the bittersweet aromas that blossom on the palate. Many bartenders pay homage to this cocktail style, trying to coax complexity out of just a few simple elements. It is said that this drink was first created in Florence in 1919 for Count Camillo Negroni, who insisted upon adding a kick to his Americano cocktail. The bartender substituted gin for the club soda, and a legend was born. The Negroni was classically served on the rocks but was adapted to be served straight up to prevent the flavors from being watered down. (See photograph)

    author: 
    notes: The term “tifozi” is slang used to describe hardcore Italian soccer fans, and there is nothing more hardcore Italian than this aperitivo. The Tifozi (see photograph) is an EO original based on the Americano cocktail, intended to be a humorous salute to its namesake. It is bitter, sweet, sour, and fizzy with the addition of San Pellegrino Aranciata, a natural orange-flavored soda. The lime wheels add freshness and life to the cocktail.

    notes: "The Americano is the quintessential Italian aperitivo. When it was first created at Gaspare Campari’s bar in Milan in the 1860s, it was named Milano-Torino for its two main ingredients: Campari from Milan and Cinzano from Turin. The drink quickly became popular as an afternoon quencher at outdoor caffès in the Italian piazzas. The name changed during Prohibition due to the mass of thirsty American tourists who fell in love with it. Some fifty years later, this drink would inspire one of the most fantastic aperitifs ever: the Negroni. It is little noted that the Americano is the first cocktail that James Bond orders in Ian Fleming’s first novel Casino Royale, long before he orders a Martini."

  - name: Pêche Bourbon
    author: 
    notes: "Pêche bourbon is simply the French way of saying “peach bourbon.” These two items are as compatible a pairing as strawberries and vanilla. We wanted to showcase our peach-infused bourbon without overshadowing any of its subtle beauty. We blended it in the most straightforward way, with sugar and Peychaud’s bitters, then followed the ritual used to make the classic Sazerac cocktail: we first “season” the serving glass with French peach cordial. The ingredients swirl together in a slow dance, exciting the palate, then leaving it longing for more. This is a very delicate yet powerful cocktail. It is a great aperitif; it pairs well with grilled meats and seafood; and it is sublime as an after-dinner drink with a fruit tart or cake."
    glassware:

    - ½ ounce Massenez crème de pêche or peach liqueur
    - 1 raw brown sugar cube 
    - ½ teaspoon superfine sugar
    - 3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters
    - 3 dashes Fee Brothers peach bitters
    - 2 ounces Peach-Infused Bourbon
    - 1 mint sprig, for garnish

    - Swirl it around until the inside of the glass is completely coated, then discard the excess. 
    - Place in the freezer to chill.

    - Muddle the sugars and bitters into a consistent paste. 
    - Add the bourbon and stir gently.

  - name: Sazerac
    author: 
    notes: The Sazerac was invented by pharmacist Antoine Amedee Peychaud in New Orleans sometime in the early 1800s. In his French Quarter drugstore, M. Peychaud served his concoction of Sazerac cognac, absinthe, sugar, and his homemade bitters in the large end of an egg cup–what the French call a coquetier. (There had been speculation that the word cocktail comes from the mispronunciation of coquetier, but this myth has been disproven.) Later, rye whiskey replaced Sazerac cognac because it was more readily available, but the name stayed. The traditional making of a Sazerac is a ritual still practiced in New Orleans. It begins with the bartender pouring Herbsaint into a rocks glass, then tossing the glass in the air while yelling “Sazerac!” Coating the inside of a glass with liquor is referred to as “seasoning” the glass. The glass is then chilled as the cocktail is made. At Employees Only, we make Sazeracs by seasoning the glass with our Absinthe Bitters, and we use Angostura bitters in addition to Peychaud’s.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - ¼ ounce Absinthe Bitters
    - 1 raw brown sugar cube
    - ½ teaspoon superfine sugar
    - 3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    - 2½ ounces Rittenhouse 100-proof rye whiskey
    - 1 lemon twist, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour the Absinthe Bitters into a rocks glass. 
    - Swirl it around until the inside of the glass is completely coated, then discard the excess. 
    - Place in the freezer to chill. 
    - Place both sugars in the bottom of a mixing glass and saturate them with the Peychaud’s and Angostura bitters. 
    - Muddle the sugars and bitters into a consistent paste. 
    - Add the whiskey and stir gently. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and stir for 40 revolutions. 
    - Strain into the seasoned rocks glass and garnish with a lemon twist.

  - name: Provençal
    author: 
    notes: The Provençal is Employees Only’s most romantic original aperitif and a seductive start to an intimate dinner. Mouthwatering, sexy, and savory, it was created as a pairing for raw oysters to heighten the sensual experience. After years of watching certain cocktails being erroneously labeled “Martinis,” we felt the need to get back to the roots of the Martini and create a gin and vermouth concoction. We use lavender-infused Plymouth gin and French dry vermouth scented with herbes de Provence and blend them with Cointreau to give the Provençal its unique appearance and flavor. We hoped it would rival the standard dry Martini as the predinner cocktail, and it exceeded all expectations. The Provençal is a tribute to the golden age of cocktails when bartenders made many of their own ingredients in-house–it is the archetypical EO aperitif. Both the gin and vermouth infusions are easy to make, and the results are truly extraordinary.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Lavender-Infused Gin
    - 1¼ ounces Vermouth de Provence

    notes: "The majesty of cocktails, the Martini is the most iconic mixed drink in the world. The name itself conjures up an image of the V-shaped cocktail glass with an olive resting in its depth. There is much debate about the origin of this drink. What is not in question is that this cocktail has evolved over time. Its simplicity is an illusion: the dry Martini takes years to master. The clear stillness and serenity of the final drink is an expression of the years of skill and experience of the person stirring it, and the proper execution of this cocktail is an exercise in honing the craft of cocktail making."

  - name: Vesper
    author: Ian Fleming
    year: 1953
    notes: The original recipe for the Vesper was created not by a bartender but by popular spy novelist Ian Fleming. In Fleming’s 1953 book Casino Royale, Agent 007 instructs the bartender to prepare him a Martini with “Three measures of Gordon’s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it’s ice cold, then add a large, thin slice of lemon.” Bond named this drink after Vesper Lynd, his first love interest in the series. Kina Lillet vermouth, with its flavor notes of quinine, no longer exists, so we replaced it with Lillet Blanc and a dash of Angostura bitters. We opted for a blend of Charbay clear vodka and Plymouth Navy Strength gin to finish off our interpretation. This is the cocktail that introduced the phrase “shaken, not stirred,” which changed Martini drinking forever. Thank you, Mr. Bond.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Charbay vodka
    - 1 ounce Plymouth Navy Strength gin

    author: 
    notes: "This cocktail is an Employees Only variation on the Champagne Cocktail. In champagne production, when the pinot noir skins are left to touch the juice, they add color and a soft touch of tannins. The result is some of the best aperitif wine available: rosé champagne. Other sparkling wine producers emulate this with rosé varietals, most notably the Spanish with Cava. These wines are truly magnificent, and their affordability makes them very suitable for mixed drinks. Cava rosé has a body and level of dryness ideal for adding sugar, bitters, and Campari to create a sultry variation on the classic Champagne Cocktail. This cocktail is very sexy and inviting and makes a superb aperitif, as well as a great choice for pairing with antipasti, mezes, tapas, or seafood appetizers."

    author: 
    notes: "The recipe for this cocktail appeared in the first 1862 edition of Jerry Thomas’s How to Mix Drinks or the Bon Vivant’s Companion. The original recipe illustrates the simplest incarnation of the cocktail in general: spirits or wines mixed with sugar, bitters, and water. Over the years, some recipes for the Champagne Cocktail called for the addition of brandy or cognac for a stronger kick and bigger body. But no matter what goes into it, the Champagne Cocktail has always been the choice of prominent and well-heeled U.S. citizens because champagne commands a lofty price and is a status symbol in America. We at Employees Only choose to make this cocktail with Curaçao, specifically Grand Marnier. We find that it adds more flavor notes and blends more effortlessly than does cognac. It’s a misconception that one must use the finest champagne in this cocktail. Please do not destroy a masterful tête de cuvee with bitters and sugar. Use a well-rounded nonvintage brut, which has the bones for such a cocktail."

    - Add large cold ice cubes and shake vigorously. 
    - Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. 
    - Place the mint sprig in the palm of your hand and smack it with your other hand to release the aroma. 
    - Gently place the mint on the surface of the cocktail and serve.

    author: 
    notes: By the time Sex in the City featured Carrie and the Cosmo, we were already killing this contemporary cocktail during our tenure at Pravda in the late 1990s. Our recipe stood out in the world of popular downtown nightlife destinations as the hallmark of what a Cosmopolitan should be; light pink and citrusy, with ice shards and foam surrounding a flamed orange peel. Although it speaks to trendy fashionistas, when made properly the Cosmopolitan can be a tasty libation. Clubs and marketing agencies later bastardized this drink with Rose’s lime juice, cheap triple sec, and enough cranberry juice to cure a bladder infection.
    glassware:

    steps:
    - Pour the vodka, Cointreau, and juices into a mixing glass.

  - name: Aviation
    author: 
    notes: The return of the Aviation cocktail signaled the rebirth of the classic cocktail. Using ingredients that were obscure a mere ten years ago, this drink is simple and snappy and speaks of the era surrounding Prohibition. The original Aviation cocktail was created in the early years of the twentieth century by one of us–a New York bartender, Hugo Ensslin, who was the head bartender at the Wallick Hotel. Probably his intention was to celebrate the Wright Brothers and other achievements in flight made at that time. Ensslin also published the recipe in his book, Recipes for Mixed Drinks, which appeared in 1916 and in which he called for dry gin, lemon juice, maraschino, and crème de violette. We must assume that the crème de violette Ensslin had at his disposal is different than the ones we have today, as the drink does not turn sky-blue. Harry Craddock left out the crème de violette in The Savoy Cocktail Book and so did many others. Only recently have we begun to see the emergence of really high-quality crème de violette on the market–but it still remains to be seen if it will catch on beyond cocktail geekery. We add a touch of aromatic bitters at the end to dazzle your nose and create depth.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Plymouth gin
    - 1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce Luxardo maraschino liqueur
    - ¼ ounce simple syrup
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    - 1 lemon wheel, for garnish
    - 1 brandied cherry, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour the gin, juice, liqueur, and syrup into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and shake vigorously. 
    - Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

  - name: Billionaire Cocktail
    author: 
    notes: This cocktail was created in a flash of inspiration to showcase overproof whiskey by offsetting it with wonderfully lush and flavorful ingredients. Strong Baker’s 107-proof bourbon serves as the backbone to the cocktail, providing vigor and heat. This is balanced with our rich homemade grenadine and fresh lemon juice to give a delightful sweet-and-sour balance. The Absinthe Bitters’ anise essence rounds out the cocktail, giving it a classic feel and third dimension. After conceiving the recipe, we were stumped for a name until we realized it was quite similar to a version of the Prohibition classic Millionaire Cocktail. Because of inflation and the fact that ours is a “richer” cocktail, we named it the Billionaire Cocktail.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Baker’s 107-proof bourbon
    - 1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ½ ounce simple syrup
    - ½ ounce homemade Grenadine
    - ¼ ounce Absinthe Bitters
    - 1 lemon wheel, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour the bourbon, juice, syrup, grenadine, and bitters into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and shake vigorously for 8 to 10 seconds. 
    - Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with the lemon wheel.

  - name: Millionaire Cocktail
    author: 
    notes: The Millionaire Cocktail is not as romanticized as the South Side or as revered as a Whiskey Sour. Little is known about this Prohibition-era cocktail except that it was a popular name for cocktails of that time. We have found five different cocktails carrying the moniker, with recipes varying from whiskey to rum to gin. Even Harry Craddock, author of The Savoy Cocktail Book, listed two completely unrelated recipes as Millionaire Cocktail No. 1 and Millionaire Cocktail No. 2. The first consists of Jamaican rum, apricot brandy, sloe gin, lime juice, and grenadine; the second has anisette, egg white, gin, and absinthe. We have provided the Millionaire recipe from The How and When cocktail book by Hyman Gale and Gerald F. Marco, first printed in 1938. Although it inspired the name for our Billionaire Cocktail, we have made some slight adjustments to the proportions and added lemon juice for balance.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Knob Creek bourbon
    - ¾ ounce Grand Marnier
    - 1 egg white
    - ½ ounce homemade Grenadine
    - ¼ ounce Ricard pastis
    - ½ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - Freshly grated nutmeg, for garnish

    - Pour the bourbon, liqueur, egg white, grenadine, pastis, and juice into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and shake vigorously.

  - name: Fraise Sauvage
    author: 
    notes: The Fraise Sauvage was inspired by the famous pre-Prohibition classic, the French 75. The name itself is a play on words in French, meaning “wild strawberry.” This cocktail uses our EO homemade Wild Strawberry Cordial to create a cocktail in the classic style. We shake together Plymouth gin with fresh lemon juice, simple syrup, and strawberry cordial, then top it off with demi-sec champagne. For our first summer menu at Employees Only, we wanted to put on the list a cocktail that would be a crowd-pleaser. Fraise Sauvage is the EO equivalent of the ubiquitous Caprese salad. The flavors of gin, strawberry, and champagne are a timeless combination and showcase how simple flavors can become complex when combined. To make this cocktail without the strawberry cordial, simply muddle a whole fresh strawberry, then follow the rest of the directions.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ ounces Plymouth gin
    - ½ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ¼ ounce simple syrup
    - ½ ounce Wild Strawberry Cordial
    - 2 ounces demi-sec champagne
    - 1 half strawberry, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour the gin, juice, syrup, and cordial into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes, cover, and shake vigorously for 7 or 8 seconds. 
    - Pour the champagne into a chilled cocktail glass and pour the cocktail over it. 
    - Garnish with half a strawberry.

  - name: French 75
    author: 
    notes: "The name “French 75” refers to the most deadly and accurate artillery piece of World War I: the 75-mm field gun. Some credit WWI French-American flying ace Raoul Lufbery as the creator, who poured a little cognac into his beloved champagne for added kick. Other recipes list gin as the main ingredient in what is basically a Tom Collins with champagne instead of club soda. This recipe is first seen in The Savoy Cocktail Book; author Harry Craddock notes that it “hits with remarkable precision.” Across the pond, the French 75 was made popular at New York’s infamous Stork Club, which opened during Prohibition and survived into the 1960s. Looking back at the historical cocktail record, it seems most likely that this cocktail began as the gin version, then makers shifted to cognac in order to make the drink a bit more French."

    author: 
    notes: The story of the Roselle highlights the creative process at Employees Only. After seeking a hibiscus cordial, bar manager Robert Krueger infused the dried blossoms into syrup for a delicious result. The citrus and floral elements immediately suggested a pairing with gin, and the botanicals in Tanqueray No. 10 specifically led to grapefruit. A quick shake revealed that the red of the hibiscus turns an iridescent rose when mixed–inspiring the drink’s name. The resulting drink is a reminder that a confident bartender should never be afraid of mixing a pink drink–or of drinking one, for that matter.

  - name: Gimlet
    author: 
    notes: The Gimlet, invented by a medical doctor, was born out of necessity. Sir Thomas D. Gimlette, a British naval surgeon, prescribed his vitamin-packed cocktail to sailors to prevent scurvy. His daily dose consisted of navy strength Plymouth gin, which was rationed to officers (common sailors drank rum), and lime cordial, which was a way of preserving lime juice on long sea voyages. The Gimlet found its way into social drinking and became as recognized as the Martini or Manhattan, due to the instant availability of Rose’s Lime Juice. Unfortunately, over years of de-evolution, lime cordials on the market fell victim to the same pressures as other massproduced products—to become more profitable. Today, most have little to do with lime and more to do with high-fructose corn syrup and artificial colorings. With the rebirth of the classic cocktail over the last decade, many enthusiasts have decided that fresh lime juice and simple syrup are the way to go, but in our opinion, the resulting “gin daiquiri” does not honor the spirit of the original cocktail and should not be called a Gimlet. True Gimlet drinkers look down their noses at such an abomination. To bridge the gap between both camps, we created our own all-natural lime cordial using lime and kaffir lime leaf. It is stunningly simple and classically structured but surprisingly novel and sophisticated.

  - name: Grapefruit Gimlet
    author: 
    notes: "The Grapefruit Gimlet came as an inspiration upon tasting Charbay ruby red grapefruit vodka. Unlike other flavored vodkas, this producer actually uses real fruit in a natural process of infusion. Charbay pays Texas ruby red grapefruit growers premium prices to leave the fruit on the tree until they are overripe. Then they are shipped to California, where father-and-son distillers Miles and Marko Karakasevic grind the whole fruits–skins, pulp, and juice–then let them sit in alcohol for six months to extract the real fruit flavor. This essence is then strained and added to clear vodka. The result of this infusion is unlike any other flavored vodka. The beauty of our Grapefruit Gimlet is that it consists of only three ingredients: Charbay grapefruit vodka, fresh lime juice, and agave nectar. This recipe is very simple to make and really accentuates the grapefruit vodka. Make it and taste it and you’ll feel like you’ve just bitten into a sweet, ripe ruby red grapefruit through the skin. It’s refreshing and full flavored, and it begs for another sip."

  - name: Gin Rickey
    author: 
    notes: The Gin Rickey is the most prominent member of the Rickey Cocktail family, which basically calls for a shot of any straight spirit, a splash of freshly squeezed lime juice, and club soda, served tall. The story has it that the founding father of this cocktail trend was a retired Civil War colonel and lobbyist, Joe Rickey. The man loved his bourbon with soda and a squeeze of lime. He refused sugar on the grounds that “drinks with sugar heat the blood,” and as a string-puller in D.C., he clearly didn’t want passion to interfere with clear thinking. We played with this cocktail but shelved it, feeling that although it is a wonderful drink, it was not intriguing enough to put on our menu. Then we made our own lime cordial. The concentrated flavor of the sweetened cordial created the same feel as the original, only with more depth and intensity and more focus on the gin. Also, our lime cordial is sweetened not with sugar but with agave nectar, which has a much lower glycemic index and therefore should not “heat” the blood as much. The good colonel would be pleased.

  - name: Gin on Gin Julep
    author: 
    notes: The original Gin Julep published in Harry Johnson’s 1882 Bartenders’ Manual was the only other julep that people generally ordered besides the whiskey and brandy versions. It’s likely that the prominent malt flavor of Holland gin, a product we know today as genever, appealed to the whiskey lover. With the rerelease of Bols Genever gin to the U.S. marketplace, we tested this cocktail but were not at first happy with the results. So we cut the amount of genever in half and substituted Plymouth gin for the other half–and then we had one of those great drinks that will stand the test of time. It is unlike most cocktails because it has two base spirits. It is delicate, light yet full-flavored, and very refreshing. It is a cocktail to fall in love with.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 15 large mint leaves
    - ½ ounce homemade Mint Syrup
    - 1 ounce Bols Genever gin
    - 1 ounce Plymouth gin
    - 1 splash club soda
    - 1 mint sprig, for garnish
    steps:
    - Muddle the mint leaves and mint syrup in the bottom of a rocks or Old Fashioned glass. 
    - Fill the glass with large cold ice cubes. 
    - Pour in the genever and Plymouth gin.

    author: 
    notes: "This Mint Julep is the quintessential American cocktail, so regal that it sits at the summit of cocktail Olympus next to classics like the Martini, the Manhattan, and the Sazerac. It hails from Kentucky and Virginia and is enjoyed throughout the South. We know for sure it was consumed as early as 1790, particularly in the summertime. A particular type of spearmint, Kentucky Colonel, is best suited for the preparation of this cocktail, commonly served in a silver or pewter cup to keep it chilled longer. Since 1938, it has been the official drink of the Kentucky Derby, where up to 120,000 mint juleps are served over the period of two days. There are many historical and regional versions: some use bourbon, others brandy; some only tap the mint, others pulverize it into a paste. We favor a bourbon recipe in which fresh spearmint is bruised with a ladle, then sugar, bitters, and bourbon are added; the mixture is chilled overnight so the mint releases all the flavors and essential oils into the whiskey, then strained the following day for final julep preparation. To simplify this process so the julep can be made to order, we use our own homemade Mint Syrup."

  - name: Havana-Style Mojito
    author: 
    notes: The Mojito was born at the La Bodeguita del Medio in Havana, Cuba, in the 1940s. Legend has it that Ernest Hemingway wrote “My Mojito in La Bodeguita,” which still can be read today, hanging on the wall. Others claim that this was a forgery, a marketing ploy of the restaurant owners to promote their mojito cocktail and bring in tourists after communism took over. Over the last decade, the Mojito has quietly become one of the most recognized drinks in the world. Today, people carelessly consume it regardless of the season or weather. But somewhere along the way, the mojito has been reconfigured as a short, stout, bittersweet rum hybrid of muddled lime wedges and pulverized mint. Then a friend of ours who went to film school in Cuba came back and pointed out that mojitos were supposed to be tall, light, and fizzy, clean and effervescent. We brought it back to its true form and labeled it the Havana-Style Mojito. Although it never made it onto our menu, it is the closest you can get to a true mojito without the luxury of Havana Club Cuban rum. It is a fantastic cocktail–but please don’t order it while there is snow on the ground.

    author: 
    notes: This fall version of the Ginger Smash has been with us for years, but it truly came together with the addition of allspice dram, a highly bitter and aromatized liqueur. It contrasts two of our favorite ingredients–pears and ginger. Gin mixes very well with pears because it helps open up the subtle aromas that these pome fruits are prized for. Green Bartlett pears are our choice in this cocktail because of their tartness and solid nature. Feel free to try whatever pear you can find in its peak of season.

  - name: Whiskey Smash
    author: 
    notes: According to David Wondrich, the Whiskey Smash comes from the Baroque Age of the cocktail. Obviously, it served as inspiration for our seasonal Ginger Smash cocktails, but it is in all its features a julep–the only difference being that the Smash has some ornamental fruits for garnish and is always shaken so that the mint is “smashed”–hence the name. From all the smashes in the Baroque Age, it appears that the Brandy Smash was the most popular (same drink, different base spirit–try it out for yourself), but somehow the whiskey version stuck with us. Maybe sampling Dale DeGroff’s rocking peach whiskey smash sealed the deal for us, or maybe it was just that we loved the term “smashed.” In any case, this is a very simple drink to make, and we suggest that you use our homemade Mint Syrup in place of simple syrup for a far more dimensional cocktail experience. This cocktail is one of the very few that contains no juice but nevertheless should be shaken and smashed.

    author: 
    notes: This Grand Fashioned was the first-place winner of Grand Marnier and the New York Film Festival’s Independent Cocktail Festival in 1999, long before we ever opened Employees Only. The idea was to get two ounces of Grand Marnier into a cocktail without being cloyingly sweet. To balance this much Curaçao, we muddle fresh blood oranges with lime juice, sugar, and dashes of Angostura bitters. This cocktail looked so much like the contemporary recipe for an Old Fashioned that the name just took over. For the competition, we garnished the drink with a kumquat that had to be tediously scored and peeled to resemble a “blossom,” then stained inside with grenadine. You can imagine our surprise when, upon winning, we were told we would need to make five hundred of these cocktails at the premiere for All About My Mother by director Pedro Almodóvar. The Grand Fashioned is so rich and luscious that it can be consumed as an after-dinner drink.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1 teaspoon superfine sugar
    - 3 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 3 blood orange wedges, peeled
    - 2 ounces Grand Marnier
    - ¾ ounce freshly squeezed lime juice
    steps:
    - Muddle the sugar, bitters, and oranges in the bottom of a mixing glass. 
    - Add the Grand Marnier and juice. 
    - Add enough large cold ice cubes to fit in a rocks glass and shake hard but briefly. 
    - Pour all the unstrained liquid into a rocks glass and serve.

    notes: "The name “Old Fashioned” here refers to what was once known as the Whiskey Cocktail. It is a cocktail in the simplest terms: spirit, water, bitters, and sugar. Sometime in the late 1800s, the use of the word “cocktail” broadened far beyond its original definition, so it was necessary to come up with a new moniker to distinguish the older cousin. Many self-described purists will argue that there is only one way to make this drink properly. We disagree. So if you decide to order a whiskey cocktail as an Old Fashioned, be precise about what you want. Intentionally being ambiguous about your order is just a nice way of being obnoxious."
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1 raw brown sugar cube
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - ¼ ounce cold water
    - 2 ounces American whiskey (at least 100-proof; rye, bourbon, corn, or blended)
    - 1 lemon twist, for garnish
    steps:
    - Muddle the sugar, bitters, and water in the bottom of a rocks glass. 
    - Add the whiskey and 1 large cold ice cube. 
    - Twist the lemon peel over the drink and drop it in.

    notes: We will not simply turn a blind eye to the contemporary version of the Old Fashioned–it was the first cocktail we were taught that used bitters. Somewhere between the 1890s and 1930s, what probably started out as an ornamental garnish of orange and cherry fell into the mixing glass and got muddled with sugar and bitters. We see evidence of this drink in Burke’s Complete Cocktail and Drinking Recipes from 1936, in which the fruit is muddled, whereas during the same period Old Mr. Boston Bartender’s Guide continued to add the fruit after making the drink. More than likely it was a trick used during Prohibition to mask poor-quality booze that stuck with many and was passed down over the generations. Today, many look down on this version of the cocktail, mostly because of the use of commercial, artificial maraschino cherries. Many young cocktail enthusiasts may not have enjoyed this cocktail in its original form, so we offer this restoration for them.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1 raw brown sugar cube
    - ½ teaspoon superfine sugar
    - 3 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 2 orange half-wheels
    - 4 brandied cherries
    - 2 lemon twists
    - 2 splashes club soda
    - 2½ ounces Rittenhouse 100-proof rye whiskey
    steps:
    - Muddle the sugars, bitters, 1 orange half-wheel, 3 of the cherries, and 1 lemon twist in the bottom of a rocks glass. 
    - Discard the orange and lemon skins. Add a splash of the club soda. 
    - Fill up the glass with large cold ice cubes. Carefully pour the whiskey on top. 
    - Finish with another splash of club soda and garnish with the remaining orange half-wheel, brandied cherry, and lemon twist.

  - name: Greenwich Sour
    author: 
    notes: Stunning to look at, the Greenwich Sour is rich and frothy, with a band of red wine floating on top. It is a variation of a Prohibition classic, the New York Sour. The key difference between the two is that we have added an egg white in our take, a practice common throughout the history of making sours. Many people today are wary about consuming raw eggs for fear of salmonella. The risk of contamination is actually quite low and can be reduced even more by using eggs from free-range chickens; add high-proof spirit to that, and the chances of getting sick are reduced to almost nothing. The egg white adds texture to the cocktail by trapping air and requires a very long hard shake to create the necessary consistency. Many bartenders will shake the egg white on its own first to begin this process. To give the Greenwich Sour its necessary backbone, it is important to use high-proof whiskey to cut through the sour body. The wine’s tannins add depth to the cocktail and complete its finish.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - ¾ ounces Wild Turkey 101-proof rye whiskey
    - ¾ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - 1 egg white
    - 1 orange half-wheel, for garnish
    - 1 brandied cherry, for garnish
    - ¾ ounce dry red wine (Malbec or Syrah)
    steps:
    - Pour the whiskey, juice, syrup, and egg white into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and shake vigorously for at least 1 minute; when your hands start to freeze and you can’t shake any more, you’ll know it’s enough. 
    - Strain into a rocks glass over large cold ice cubes. 
    - Float the red wine on top. 
    - Garnish with the orange and cherry.

  - name: New York Sour
    author: 
    notes: We discovered the New York Sour in the summer of 2003 while we were researching cocktails to put on the opening drink list for Keith McNally’s Schiller’s Liquor Bar on the Lower East Side. Visually inviting, this sour is deep yellow with a crimson band of red wine floating on top. The origin of the cocktail is shrouded in mystery, but it is certain that it was served at several New York City speakeasies in the late 1920s. It was no surprise to discover that this cocktail was New York’s Prohibition-era favorite, probably because the lemon juice, sugar, and wine camouflaged and successfully balanced the bad watered-down whiskey common in those days. It was the cool drink to have, and people who ordered it were “in the know.” Think of it as the Prohibition-era Cosmo–or any other status-symbol cocktail that clearly advertises itself in appearance. Made with better ingredients, the cocktail became a masterpiece of complex flavors and mouthfeel. A chef friend of ours once remarked that this drink is like sangria à la minute–and one of the few cocktails that can be successfully paired with a main course.

  - name: Whiskey Sour
    author: 
    notes: The Whiskey Sour is the pinnacle of the sour cocktail family and unarguably its most famous member. In Harry Johnson’s Bartenders’ Manual, the preferred method is to stir together sugar, water, and lemon juice before shaking with whiskey. During the dark ages of the cocktail in the 1970s and ‘80s, it was turned into a two-ingredient drink in which cheap blended whiskey was poured over ice with sweet-and-sour mix from a soda gun. However, the real Whiskey Sour has been resurrected and can be made in its pure form almost anywhere that has a decent cocktail menu, even by aspiring actors working as bartenders. It is a very straightforward cocktail with a strong base of whiskey mixed with simple syrup and sour, freshly squeezed lemon juice. To bring together the body, add a splash of orange juice–just realize that with more than a splash, this drink becomes a Stone Sour. It is a fairly easy drink that can help you master the balance between sweet and sour to spirit. Make sure you shake it enough so that a thin foam rests on the surface–that is the hallmark for Whiskey Sour fans.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Rittenhouse 100-proof rye whiskey
    - 1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ½ ounce freshly squeezed orange juice

    - 1 orange half-wheel, for garnish
    - 1 brandied cherry, for garnish

    - Pour the whiskey, juices, and syrup into a mixing glass. Add large cold ice cubes and shake vigorously. 
    - Strain into a chilled rocks or Old Fashioned glass over large cold ice cubes. 
    - Garnish with the orange and cherry.

  - name: New Yorker
    author: 
    notes: Robert Krueger, our bar manager, discovered the New Yorker in a vintage copy of Booth’s cocktail book from the late 1930s. It is an offshoot of the New York Sour, with the addition of club soda. Think of it as a rye Collins with a float of red wine. The New Yorker is tall and fizzy, great for a hot day, and certainly stunning to look at. This cocktail is also a great culinary example of how substituting or adding one ingredient can drastically change the style and feel of a cocktail. The club soda changes the character from a simple sour into a long drink, which changes the perception of consumption by reducing the acidity and intensity in each sip. Whereas a Whiskey Sour is more a late-evening and cold-weather drink, the New Yorker tends to be more of a lazy-afternoon and summertime treat.

  - name: Hemingway Daiquiri
    author: 
    notes: They say that the Hemingway Daiquiri was invented for Ernest Hemingway in the La Floradita bar in Cuba. Whether the stories are true or false, no person in history can match Ernest Hemingway as an Olympian cocktail connoisseur. He seems to have been the bartenders’ muse, allegedly ordering up the creation of new cocktails everywhere he went. He was at Harry’s American Bar in Paris when the Bloody Mary was born, he was a part of the Ritz crew that sipped Sidecars, and he fancied Mojitos at La Bodeguita del Medio in Havana. But only this Daiquiri has the honor of bearing his name. He loved it so much that he always had a double serving, which earned the cocktail the moniker Papa Doble, or Double for Daddy. Legend has it that Hemingway once consumed sixteen of them in a row and walked out as if nothing had happened. In our take on the Hemingway Daiquiri, we replace Bacardi with 10 Cane rum to add grassy sugarcane notes to the cocktail; a splash of simple syrup balances the tartness. The result tastes equally of all its components–a great cocktail to practice nosing while building the drink, as each ingredient drastically changes the aromas.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1¾ ounces 10 Cane rum
    - ¾ ounce Luxardo maraschino liqueur
    - 1 ounce freshly squeezed lime juice
    - ¾ ounce freshly squeezed grapefruit juice
    - ¼ ounce simple syrup
    - 1 lime wheel, for garnish
    - 1 brandied cherry, for garnish

    - Pour the rum, liqueur, juices, and syrup into a mixing glass.

    notes: The British Royal Navy, like every armed force, loves rules and discipline. So in 1740, they issued a rule that every sailor be supplied with a daily ration of grog, which he had to consume. No exceptions! By 1795, the recipe for grog called for rum, water, lime or lemon juice, and sugar. What a splendid idea! You’ve got to love the British; with that act, not only did they cure and prevent scurvy, but they also ensured that the crews had something to look forward to every day on long voyages. It was so popular that it quickly spread across the whole Caribbean and South America. The origins of the Daiquiri itself are somewhat vague, but most clues lead to a bar in Santiago, Cuba, called Venus. Near that bar there is a beach called Daiquiri–hence the name. The drink itself was supposedly invented by an American engineer, Jennings Cox, general manager of the Spanish American Iron Company who while stationed in Cuba ran out of gin and turned to rum to entertain his guests. The original recipe is simply beautiful, relying on the freshness of the limes and the quality of the rum. It is an exercise in balancing sweet and sour while letting the light, grassy, earthy rum flavor carry through.

  - name: Jersey Devil
    author: 
    notes: There is an old tale about a creature that dwells in the Pine Barrens of southern New Jersey. The Jersey Devil is three and a half feet tall, with hoofed hind legs, claws on its front legs, a horse-like head, and bat wings. Rumored to be born of a witch and Satan himself, the Jersey Devil has been blamed for odd sightings, missing people, and stolen livestock since colonial days. Around the same time the legend was born, the Laird family began distilling apple cider. Perfecting the family recipe for applejack, the Laird & Company Distillery became the first commercial distillery in America and is still in business today. They even weathered Prohibition, selling sweet cider and applesauce until they received a special license to produce “medicinal brandy.” Their two main products are Laird’s Apple Brandy and Laird’s AppleJack. The brandy is a 100-proof spirit distilled solely from apples; the AppleJack is a blended spirit of 35 percent apple brandy and 65 percent whiskey. Our Jersey Devil cocktail artistically uses the 100-percent apple brandy and blends it with a unique ingredient–the English Bishop, which calls for roasting a clove-studded orange in a fire and infusing it with port wine. This drink was one of the first to fall into our “fancy cocktail” category because of the detail in the ingredients. It’s also a killer drink and can be successfully used to bait and tranquilize a Jersey Devil.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1¾ ounces English Bishop
    - 1½ ounces Laird’s straight apple brandy
    - ½ ounce Berentzen Apfelkorn apple liqueur
    - 3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters
    - 1 orange half-wheel, for garnish

    - Pour the English Bishop, brandy, apple liqueur, and bitters into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and stir for 40 revolutions.

  - name: Jack Rose
    author: 
    notes: Before corporate America overwhelmed New York City with its massive amounts of money, shallowness, and brainwashing, the Big Apple was a very lively and dangerous place. Historically, no other city housed such a menagerie of characters, lowlifes, gangsters, and crooks, whose activities gained them a healthy prominence and romantic fame. One of those guys was Jacob “Jack” Rosenzweig, aka Jack Rose. Born in Poland, this famous gambler of the day grew up in the late 1800s in Connecticut and later moved to New York City, where he opened a gambling den, Second Avenue. Although he was not of the caliber of Lucky Luciano or Meyer Lansky, he became very popular when he turned state’s evidence against Lieutenant Charles Becker, a crooked cop linked to bookies and gambling houses around town. Due to Jack Rose’s testimony, Becker was convicted and received the death sentence. Jack in turn became a hero for the common man. The Jack Rose cocktail was created in his honor in 1912 or 1913, using applejack as the dominant ingredient. It remained a crowd-pleaser throughout the Prohibition era because apple brandy was easy to bootleg and was considered one of the safest spirits of the day. We love the version with our homemade grenadine and believe that it makes a fantastic contribution to this Prohibition-era classic.

  - name: Mai Tai
    author: Victor "Trader Vic" Bergeron
    year: 1944
    notes: The Mai Tai cocktail is Elvis with a guitar singing in the sunset in Hawaii. It was invented in 1944 by Victor “Trader Vic” Bergeron, who mixed Jamaican rum, lime juice, a few dashes of orange Curaçao, French almond syrup, and rock candy syrup. According to Trader Vic history, it was served to some friends from Tahiti, who promptly proclaimed “Mai tai, roa ae!”–which in Tahitian means “Out of this world, the best!” When this drink is made right, it is really, really super tasty. By default this cocktail is in the Tiki cocktail family, which became popular after World War II when soldiers from the South Pacific returned home in the 1940s and ‘50s. This trend began in Hawaii and on the West Coast and, then traveled across the nation. Unfortunately, like most cocktails of that era, the recipe was artificialized and cheapened over several decades and even now in Hawaii it is still made with commercial Mai Tai mixers and artificial flavors. At Employees Only, we make our tribute to this Tiki classic with twelve-year-old Flor de Caña Nicaraguan rum, the best French orange Curaçao, Lebanese almond syrup, and fresh lime juice. The traditional rock candy syrup was left out to keep the cocktail balanced, not just sweet.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Flor de Caña 12-year-old rum
    - ¾ ounce Marie Brizard orange Curaçao

    author: 
    notes: The Sidecar is another famous cocktail that came out of Paris in the Twenties, thanks to Prohibition driving the best bartenders out of the country. It is said to have been invented at the Ritz Hotel by American ex-pat Frank Meyer, the head bartender. It was a favorite of Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Henry Miller. The Sidecar is also an ideal after-dinner option or even a nightcap because of its “candied” nature. Cognac is rarely mixed with juices, as the subtle qualities in fine brandy are easily lost in cocktails. The Sidecar is one exception–it blends cognac and Cointreau beautifully and balances them out with fresh lemon juice. The key to this cocktail is its sugar rim on the glass. This dissolves on the tongue and mixes with the rest of the drink to create the perfect balance, leaving room for the brandy. For a simple variation on the Sidecar, add a splash of Benedictine and lose the sugar rim to create the Honeymoon.

    notes: This all-year-round cocktail, an Employees Only original, is a fine example of what you can do with a less-inspiring spirit like vodka. We wanted to combine traditional Mediterranean flavors such as figs, lemon, and honey. Mixing with vodka is a challenge similar to that of cooking with tofu; no matter what you do to it, it’s still tofu. All the flavor and texture comes from the other ingredients in the mixture; vodka really contributes only alcohol to the structure of the cocktail. In the case of the Mediterra, any other spirit would interfere with the clean balance of fig to honey.

    author: 
    notes: Have you ever heard the slang term “the bee’s knees”? It was used in the 1920s during the Noble Experiment to describe something really cool and hip. The cocktail itself appeared sometime during Prohibition. The recipe appears in cocktail books printed after 1936, which helps back this theory. It is fairly easy to make—the trick is to use honey syrup instead of honey itself, as honey will not dissolve when shaken with ice in a cocktail. We suggest Cadenhead’s Old Raj saffron-infused gin, at 55 percent alcohol by volume. Some authorities claim this cocktail can also be made with rum. If you’re game, we suggest the Flor de Caña four-year-old clear rum, which adds the perfect amount of grassiness and earthiness to the overall flavor profile.

His first blend, Pimm’s No. 1 Cup, was a gin-based liqueur infused with quinine, fruit extracts, and a secret blend of herbs. The word “cup” in this case refers to a punch made with spirits, wine, and soda or sparkling wine. Pimm started commercially offering Pimm’s No. 1 Cup around 1859, and by the end of World War II five more bottled blends had been developed: Pimm’s No. 2 Cup, based on Scotch whisky; No. 3, on brandy; No. 4, on rum; No. 5, on rye whiskey; and finally, No. 6, on vodka. Originally, most cups were garnished with cucumber or cucumber peel. Employees Only pays tribute to this forgotten trend in our Pimm’s Cup cocktail, which can be made as a long drink or in large batches or pitchers for parties. We build the base of the cocktail with Cointreau and fresh lime juice to add more alcohol and firm up the body. Fresh mint and delicious thinly sliced cucumbers are lightly bruised in the shake to release aroma, and we top it off with ginger ale, which adds to and opens up the bright flavors of the cocktail."
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Pimm's No. 1 Cup
    - ¾ ounce Cointreau
    - ¾ ounce freshly squeezed lime juice
    - 3 thin cucumber wheels
    - 6 fresh mint leaves
    - 1 ounce ginger ale
    steps:
    - Pour the Pimm’s, Cointreau, and lime juice into a Collins glass. 
    - Add the cucumber and mint. 
    - Fill with large cold ice cubes and cover the glass with a small shaker top. 
    - Shake briefly and top off with ginger ale.

  - name: Classic Pimm's Cup
    author: 
    notes: Pimm’s is as British as cricket or a cup of tea and has gained in recognition with the general rebirth of the classic cocktail. The original recipe for the Pimm’s Cup is a very simple affair of Pimm’s No. 1 and lemon-lime soda served over ice with slices of cucumber. The Brits refer to this simply as Pimm’s and Lemonade (“lemonade” being the UK term for lemon-lime soda). What is fantastic about this recipe is the simplicity of ingredients. Add some cucumber and even a little mint and you have already elevated the cocktail. Try substituting champagne in the cocktail or even adding seasonal fruits to the mix, and you are light years beyond a simple highball.

  - name: Gringo Pisco Sour
    author: 
    notes: We have served this variation of the Pisco Sour ever since we first learned about the drink in the mid-1990s. There weren’t many Pisco choices available back then, so we worked with what we had. One brand we used was Pisco Capel Reservado from Chile, a blend of 30 percent Muscat and 70 percent Pedro Jimenez and Torontel grapes, which give the spirit a nice sweet full flavor, as it’s aged in wood for up to 6 months. Because of the slight oak, it combines beautifully with fresh lemon juice, so our variation was a gringo-styled sour, tall over ice. Little did we know that the true Peruvian Pisco Sour was created by a gringo as well.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Pisco Capel Reservado brandy
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - ¾ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ½ ounce freshly squeezed orange juice
    - 1 egg white
    - 3 dashes Angostura bitters, for garnish
    - 1 orange half-wheel, for garnish
    - 1 brandied cherry, for garnish    
    steps:
    - Pour the brandy, syrup, juices, and egg white into a mixing glass. 
    - Close the shaker and shake very hard without ice for a few seconds. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and shake vigorously for up to 30 seconds. 
    - Strain into a Collins glass filled with ice and garnish with the bitters, orange, and cherry.

  - name: Peruvian Pisco Sour
    author: 
    notes: "The Pisco Sour is the official drink of Peru; there is even a National Pisco Sour Day, celebrated the first Saturday in February. Pisco brandy was first established by Spanish conquistadors, who planted grape vines as they traversed the mountainous terrains of Chile and Peru–and Chile also claims the Pisco as a national treasure. There is good reason for the debate, as Pisco was the first distilled spirit in the New World. The now-classic Pisco Sour was created in the 1920s by ex-pat American bartender Victor V. “Gringo” Morris at the Morris’ Bar in Lima, as a local variation on the Whiskey Sour. The cocktail became a favorite among the locals and quickly spread up the West Coast of America as far north as San Francisco, where it was popular by the late 1930s. This version contained pisco brandy, egg white, lime juice, simple syrup, and aromatic bitters served frothy and straight up. A specific kind of lime called Limon de Pica is the right ingredient for the Peruvian classic. Some places in Peru grate nutmeg or cinnamon on top of the cocktail to finish it; our version includes the nutmeg. The Peruvian Pisco Sour is the perfect brunch companion as a restorative drink: musky and clean, with a rich texture and alluring bitters."

    author: 
    notes: Pisco became popular on the West Coast, especially in San Francisco, during the days of the Gold Rush. Many ships would bring men from the East Coast around Cape Horn, through the Strait of Magellan and up the West Coast. One of the stops for provisions was the popular port town of Pisco. There they would load up on the eponymous brandy and bring whatever was left with them to Northern California. Soon the spirit became a commodity on the trade route of the western seaboard. (This would, of course, later decline with the creation of the Panama Canal cutting Peru out of the route.) The Pisco Punch was created during the late 1800s by a barkeep named Duncan Nicol at the Bank Exchange and Billiard Saloon in San Francisco. The exact recipe was never shared with anyone but was enjoyed by the likes of Mark Twain and Jack London. After Nicol’s passing, those who knew offered up their interpretations of the Pisco Punch.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 1-inch cubes fresh pineapple
    - 1½ ounces Fresh Pineapple Syrup
    - 2 ounces Barsol Pisco Quebranta brandy

    - ½ ounce freshly squeezed lime juice
    - 5 drops Bitter Truth Celery Bitters

  - name: Quiet Storm
    author: 
    notes: Inspiration for the Quiet Storm comes from hot, steamy New York City summer days. EO bartender Milos Zica wanted to find a refreshing bourbon cocktail that would transcend age and gender. His journey began by creating an infusion using T Salon’s Silence tea, made from rooibos or South African red bush tea with roses, vanilla, orange, and almonds–ingredients all known for their soothing properties. He steeped it in bianco or sweet white vermouth to help retain the softer flavors while showcasing the terra-cotta hue of the tea. Finished with ginger beer, lemon juice, and simple syrup, this drink lives up to its intended purpose as an elegant yet simple refreshing whiskey cocktail. The name hints at the Silence tea moniker while also hinting at the ginger beer found in a Dark and Stormy.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Maker’s Mark bourbon
    - 1 ounce Red Bush-Infused Vermouth
    - ¾ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ½ ounce simple syrup
    - 3 ounces Spicy Ginger Beer or Fever-Tree ginger beer
    - 1 lemon wheel, for garnish
    - 1 mint sprig, for garnish
    steps:
    - Build the drink by pouring the bourbon, vermouth, juice, and syrup into a tall Collins glass. 
    - Fill up with large cold ice cubes and cover the glass with a small shaker top. 
    - Shake briefly, remove the shaker top, and top off with ginger beer. 
    - Garnish with the lemon wheel and mint sprig.

    author: 
    notes: Dark and Stormy was created specifically for Gosling’s Black Seal rum in much the same way that the Moscow Mule was created for Smirnoff. The original recipe called for Gosling’s, ginger beer, and a lime. This simple com-bination works very well to create an interesting highball, but to expand on its potential, many mixologists have reconstructed it, and its popularity has approached that of the mojito. Over the years, we have created many recipes for our Dark and Stormy, using varying ingredients such as fresh gingerroot, lime juice, and even walnut liqueur. Today, we have settled on using dark rum, homemade ginger beer, and lime juice with the addition of Velvet Falernum–a clove-almond-flavored liqueur that bridges the flavors of molasses and fiery ginger.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - ½ ounce John D. Taylor’s Velvet Falernum liqueur
    - ½ ounce freshly squeezed lime juice
    - 1 lime wheel
    - 4 ounces Spicy Ginger Beer or Fever-Tree ginger beer
    - 2 ounces Gosling’s Black Seal rum
    steps:
    - Pour the liqueur and juice into a Collins glass. Add large cold ice cubes and the lime wheel. 
    - Cover the glass with a small shaker and shake briefly. 
    - Fill with the ginger beer to one inch below the rim. 
    - Slowly layer the rum on top.

    author: 
    notes: The Moscow Mule became the flagship drink for Smirnoff vodka in the 1950s and started the vodka craze in the United States. Previously, vodka was not widely known. But this cocktail saved a vodka distillery and a restaurant in West Hollywood from going bankrupt. The first American vodka distillery was started in Connecticut by John G. Martin, using a recipe he acquired in Paris from Pierre Smirnoff. For fifteen years, vodka sales were minuscule, and the Smirnoff vodka was known as “Martin’s Folly.” At the Cock ‘n’ Bull restaurant on Hollywood’s Sunset Strip, Martin met the owner, Jack Morgan, who was sitting on a large quantity of ginger beer he had produced under his restaurant’s name. Coincidentally, Morgan was also about to lose his shirt. With both sitting on a large stock of unsold product, the myth is that they got drunk and decided to marry their miseries with a squeeze of lime. They named the concoction Moscow Mule because of the kick of the ginger. They served the new drink in a personally engraved copper mug to every movie star, and it became an overnight smash. Cold War controversy added to the appeal among the liberal Hollywood bons vivants. But it wasn’t long before vodka outshone the cocktail that had given it celebrity. Once Zsa Zsa Gabor declared that she only drank Martinis made with Smirnoff, vodka sales soared.

    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Smirnoff vodka

  - name: Ruby Tuesday
    author: 
    notes: This cocktail was first made on a Tuesday with the namesake song from the Rolling Stones playing in the background. When the drink was strained into a cocktail glass and its vibrant ruby beauty came to life, we said in unison, “Ruby Tuesday.” This cocktail combines 101-proof straight rye whiskey, Benedictine, fresh black cherry purée, fresh lemon juice, and simple syrup. Rye whiskey is the native spirit of the northern United States, where rye grains grow in abundance. The spirit was traditionally matured in new American oak barrels and bottled at least 50 percent alcohol by volume (ABV) or 100-proof. Its raw nature, combined with slightly sweet overtones and the herbal infusion of Benedictine, give this cocktail a beautiful long, lingering finish. It is a perfect representative of such classy whiskey cocktails as the Frisco Sour.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Wild Turkey 101-proof rye whiskey
    - 1 ounce Benedictine
    - ¾ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ½ ounce simple syrup
    - ¾ ounce Boiron black cherry purée or 5 ripe black cherries, muddled
    - 1 lemon twist, for garnish

    notes: "This is a cocktail that was composed by one of our bartenders, former U.S. Marine Steve Schneider. According to him, he got tired of mixing White Ladies and wanted something more exciting and powerful to offer as a gin cocktail. When asked to describe his intention, he simply said: “Alongside a beautiful lady should be a handsome man in a tux. By replacing Cointreau with a touch of simple syrup and orange bitters, you are getting an easy, yet stunning White Lady variation, which is more appealing to the modern palate.”"

    notes: This Prohibition-era cocktail is not very ladylike on the surface. On paper, it looks like a Sidecar made with gin, but nothing could be farther from the truth. We tasted this cocktail at the Savoy in London where it was invented, according to Harry Craddock, author of The Savoy Cocktail Book, which was published in 1930. Three high-quality ingredients and a master technique make this cocktail a high point of everyone’s evening. We suggest you pack your freezer full of large ice cubes, squeeze a lot of fresh lemon juice, and get going. Play some slapstick movies while you drink it–it is said that this cocktail was the favorite of Laurel and Hardy.

  - name: Waterloo
    author: 
    notes: Ah, Waterloo–the monarch of Employees Only long drinks. Seasonal to the core and perfect from mid-June until early September when watermelons are in their prime. This cocktail combines fresh, ripe watermelon; gin; and Campari in a taste explosion. The most important ingredient is the watermelon, as the flavor directly corresponds to the sweetness of the cocktail. Therefore we advise you to use organic watermelon with seeds rather than the genetically engineered seedless varietals. The seeds also provide a nice visual touch when the cocktail is served. This cocktail is also a great exercise in mixing and building flavors. You start with fresh fruit, add sugar to open up the natural flavors, then add sour to balance it out. Altogether, this mixture creates a pumped-up watermelon bomb with the body to stand up to even gin. The gin and Campari bring out the savoriness of the melon to make this cocktail a modern classic.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 4 (1x2-inch) chunks of watermelon
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - 1½ ounces Plymouth gin
    - ½ ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Campari
    - 1 watermelon wedge, with rind, for garnish
    steps:
    - Muddle the watermelon chunks and syrup in the bottom of a mixing glass until the fruit has turned into a juice. 
    - Then add the gin, juice, and Campari and fill the glass with 5 large cold ice cubes. 
    - Shake briefly and pour unstrained into a tall Collins glass. 
    - Garnish with the watermelon wedge.

    author: 
    notes: This cocktail is an Employees Only variation of the famous South Side cocktail, first served in the 1920s at the New York speakeasy Jack & Charlie’s–now known as the 21 Club. We replaced the gin with Meyer lemon-infused vodka to achieve a more balanced, subtler concoction. God only knows how many West Sides we have pushed over the bar in the last five years. It is by far the most popular cocktail served at Employees Only and lends itself naturally to being enjoyed in the sun. Why is this cocktail so popular? Even if we ignore the fact that it is a vodka cocktail and the fact that we are witnessing the end of the reign of vodka, the simplicity of a cocktail with just lemon and mint flavors makes it addictive and refreshing. It will definitely be a favorite at any cocktail party, served over ice or in pitchers.

    - 2 ounces Charbay Meyer lemon vodka
    - 1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice

    author: 
    notes: Also known as South Side Fizz, the South Side seems to have first been published by famous American bartender Harry Craddock in The Savoy Cocktail Book. His recipe called for dry gin, powdered sugar, the juice of half a lemon, and two sprigs of fresh mint, finished with a splash of siphon soda water. The birthplace is disputed among Jack & Charlie’s (now the 21 Club) in New York City, a forgotten speakeasy in the South Side of Chicago, and a Long Island country club in the late 1800s known as the Southside Club. There is no controversy that the 21 Club has served more of these than anyone over the decades and they can lay claim to the South Side as their house cocktail. We’ve altered it a bit by replacing the powdered sugar with simple syrup and adding a splash of soda to the cocktail to “wake it up,” as some recipes dictate. We do not recommend double straining it; that would reduce the body and the ornamental presence of the shaken mint.

    author: 
    notes: The Yellow Jacket cocktail was inspired by chance circumstances and a little harassment. For weeks, we had toyed with the idea of mixing together Partida Reposado tequila and St-Germain elderflower liqueur, but there was a piece of the puzzle missing. Then one evening, a bunch of obnoxious cocktail geeks came into Employees Only to stump the bartenders by ordering the Last Word cocktail. After being satisfied with that drink, they asked if we knew of another drink with Chartreuse. At that moment, Yellow Chartreuse became the ingredient needed to bind together the elderflower and tequila. So pretty and elegant, the rich yellow color grabs your attention. The true beauty of this drink, though, is the interplay of the ingredients. The light oak on the Partida Reposado tequila works so well with the St-Germain, and they in turn produce a perfect ground for Yellow Chartreuse to bring it all into balance. The orange bitters play a key role. This cocktail is similar in style to the Widow’s Kiss cocktail, as they both contain very sweet herbaceous ingredients balanced by high alcohol content. It’s named for the yellow jacket wasps that inhabit agave farms and tequila distilleries.
    glassware:

    notes: The story of the Bellini begins during Prohibition with American playboy Harry Pickering, who drank at the Europa Hotel in Venice with bartender Giuseppe Cipriani. Pickering’s family had cut off his funds in a last-ditch effort to get him back home and quit drinking. Pickering asked Cipriani for a loan of 10,000 lire–the equivalent of $61,000 today–to get his affairs in order. Cipriani lent him his life savings, only to not hear a word from Pickering for over a year. Legend has it that when Pickering returned to the bar, he ordered a drink and paid Cipriani 50,000 lire as a show of gratitude so he could open his own bar. In 1931, Harry’s Bar in Venice opened and the Bellini cocktail was created there shortly afterward.

    author: 
    notes: Blood peaches are large, with dark red skin surrounding a rich, crimson, juicy flesh that is quite tart. They bruise easily, so they are frequently broken down for use in chutneys, jams, pastries, ice creams, and sorbets. We figured this would also mean that they were ideal for making cocktails. The Bellini was the obvious choice as our first guinea pig. We accentuated the bitterness of the fruit with a little Campari while also increasing the intensity of the color. The result is a refreshing eye-opener with slight bitterness and charm. Blood peaches are very rare, fresh or frozen, so if you can get your hands on them, grab them. You can also make this cocktail by blending white peach purée with EO homemade Grenadine for color.

    notes: The Mid-Morning Fizz is our take on the classic Ramos Gin Fizz and is our choice for the perfect summer eye-opener. Our variation loses the cream of the original recipe and adds Green Chartreuse for a more pronounced spiciness. It is a lighter but more complex cocktail and loves to pair with traditional brunch grub like croque monsieur, burgers, steak and eggs, and especially French toast. Like all cocktails containing egg whites, the Mid-Morning Fizz requires a long, hard, and steady shake.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - ½ ounce Green Chartreuse
    - 1 ounce club soda
    - 1¾ ounces Martin Miller’s Westbourne Strength 100-proof gin
    - 1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - 5 drops orange blossom water
    - 1 egg white
    - 1 orange half-wheel, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour the Chartreuse into the bottom of a Collins glass. 
    - Fill with large cold ice cubes and add the club soda. 
    - Place the glass in the freezer. 
    - Combine the gin, juice, syrup, orange blossom water, and egg white in a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and shake vigorously for at least 2 minutes to make sure the cocktail has sufficient texture and frothiness. 
    - To achieve a layered effect, strain carefully over the chilled Chartreuse. 
    - Garnish with the orange.

  - name: Ramos Gin Fizz
    author: 
    notes: This frothy and very yummy long drink was invented in 1888 by Henry C. Ramos, bartender at Meyer’s Restaurant in New Orleans. Because the cocktail requires a lot of shaking, the bar used to hire so-called “shaker boys,” who would just shake one cocktail after another in times of heavy business. The Ramos Gin Fizz is a full-blown classic nowadays and is ordered regularly all the time, but it was intended to be enjoyed as a pick-me-up or an eye-opener. Meaning–in the morning. Shocking, isn’t it, how our forefathers used to drink? The key ingredient is the orange blossom water; just those few drops give the cocktail its definitive character. Widely popularized before, during, and after Prohibition at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans, it has spawned countless variations–and it’s still enjoyed on porches across the South as the sun is setting.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce club soda
    - 1¾ ounces Martin Miller’s Westbourne Strength 100-proof gin
    - 1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - 5 drops orange blossom water
    - 1 egg white
    - ¾ ounce heavy cream
    steps:
    - Fill a Collins glass with large cold ice cubes and add the club soda. 
    - Place the glass in the freezer. 
    - Combine the gin, juice, syrup, orange blossom water, egg white, and cream in a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and shake vigorously for at least 2 minutes to make sure that the cocktail has sufficient texture and frothiness. 
    - Strain carefully into the prepared Collins glass.

  - name: Widow's Kiss
    author: 
    notes: According to cocktail historians, this cocktail first appeared in print in 1895 in Modern American Drinks by George J. Kappeler. Although this drink has fallen into obscurity today, it appeared in every respectable cocktail book printed in the early twentieth century, with the same easy recipe. It seems this drink always had the favor of knowledgeable bartenders and connoisseurs, as its unique blend of flavors could be very challenging to the untrained palate of the casual drinker. In other words, this drink is best recommended for people who have moved beyond simple straightforward flavors and are looking for a carnival in the mouth. The Widow’s Kiss is a seasonal experience best enjoyed when it is cold outside. This classic cocktail is also one of the few cocktails we recommend as a digestive or an after-dinner cocktail.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Daron Fine calvados
    - 1¼ ounces Yellow Chartreuse
    - 1¼ ounces Benedictine
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    - 1 lemon twist, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour the calvados, Chartreuse, Benedictine, and bitters into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and stir for 40 revolutions. 
    - Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. 
    - Garnish with the lemon twist.

  - name: The Last Word
    author: 
    notes: "Who will have the last word? Well, obviously, the bartender! We always have the last word, because we have the goodies–the booze. So when an experienced bartender says something to you, listen, because it may well be a recommendation for this tasty cocktail. The Last Word is a mishmash of high-octane fuels, yet it comes out surprisingly balanced and delicate. Beware: have too many and this cocktail will have the last word. Allegedly this Prohibition-era cocktail’s origins are traced back to the Detroit Athletic Club, where it was invented by a gentleman named Frank Fogarty. He was said to be “a very fine monologue artist,” which is probably how the drink got its name. One thing is certain: this cocktail is now in the top five of cocktail geekdom, appearing in bars all over the country. Made properly, it is truly a wonderful concoction."
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Beefeater 24 gin
    - 1 ounce Green Chartreuse
    - 1 ounce Luxardo maraschino liqueur
    - 1 ounce freshly squeezed lime juice
    - 1 lime wheel, for garnish
    steps:
    - Pour the gin, Chartreuse, liqueur, and juice into a mixing glass. 
    - Add large cold ice cubes and shake vigorously. 
    - Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with the lime wheel.

#Pitchers, Punches, and Sangrias
  - name: Pimm's Fruit Cup
    author: 
    notes: This is a party version of the Pimm’s Cup, for when you want to give your guests a break during a three-day cricket match marathon. The difference is you have a few more fresh fruits at your disposal. We find it tastes best if in addition to the cucumber and mint you add strawberries, diced apples, and orange half-wheels. Then again, you can experiment for yourself and play with some seasonal fruits. Maybe some pears will give it your special touch; gin and pears mix really well. When preparing the large-batch cocktail, try to press the fruits and herbs very gently. It’s essential that you mix the large batch several hours ahead–ideally, the night before your guests arrive. Refrigerate it to let the fruits steep and release their essence into the blend. Makes 2 quarts.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 35 fresh mint leaves
    - 2 cups Pimm's No. 1 Cup
    - ¾ cup Cointreau
    - ¾ cup freshly squeezed lime juice
    - 20 thin cucumber wheels
    - 10 strawberries cut into quarters
    - ½ apple cut into thin slices (optional)
    - ½ Bartlett pear, cut into thin slices (optional)
    - 2 cups ginger ale
    steps:
    - Put the mint leaves into a large pitcher or smaller punch bowl and gently tap them with a muddler or small ladle to extract the essence. 
    - Add the Pimm’s, Cointreau, juice, cucumbers, strawberries, apple, and pear and stir to combine. 
    - Cover with a lid or plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. 
    - Just before serving, add large cold ice cubes and the ginger ale. 
    - Gently stir and serve in individual cups.

  - name: West Side Punch
    author: 
    notes: This punch is simple, easy, and highly refreshing. It was born out of necessity when we opened for brunch and had to serve tons of our West Side cocktails to the girls brunching in our garden. The solution was simple and a win-win for us and the guests. We love to recommend this punch in the summertime; its flavors and crispness will freshen up the nastiest hangover. Perfect for weddings, bar mitzvahs, bridal and baby showers, and all those cute get-togethers people have. Makes 1½ quarts.

    ingredients:
    - 30 fresh mint leaves, no stems

    - 1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice

  - name: Jersey City Fish House Punch
    author: 
    notes: This is one of our End of Prohibition party special punch recipes and it was adapted from the Philadelphia Fish House punch, which was a favorite of Generals Washington and Lafayette. We replaced the original cognac with our local Laird’s Applejack and got something fantastic as a result. We use all seasonal fruits for this–a beautiful feature that also makes it extra tasty. Makes 5¾ quarts.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - Decorative ice block
    - 6 Fuji apples, diced
    - 6 large Bartlett pears, diced
    - 6 lemons, cut into half-wheels
    - 6 limes, cut into half-wheels
    - 3 cups Smith & Cross Traditional Jamaica rum
    - 1 quart Laird’s AppleJack
    - 1 quart freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - 2 quarts water
    - ¾ cup Massenez crème de pêche or peach liqueur
    steps:
    - Prepare the decorative ice block, allowing a few hours for freezing.
    - Combine the fruits in a large punch bowl and add the rum, AppleJack, juice, water, and liqueur. 
    - Refrigerate for at least 4 to 5 hours. 
    - Just before serving, add the decorative ice block.

  - name: Gin Punch
    author: 
    notes: We found this recipe in Jerry Thomas’s 1862 How to Mix Drinks or the Bon Vivant’s Companion, in a recipe for a single serving. It called for Holland gin–or genever, as we know it today–and was probably a very popular drink. The back story is that when planning our first End of Prohibition party we were searching for punch recipes that could be served in teacups. So we started going through books and shot a few ideas back and forth until we found papa Jerry’s recipe. We replaced the genever with Plymouth gin, and with a few more tweaks we got it perfect. The decorative ice block adds a great visual effect. Makes 5¾ quarts.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - Decorative ice block
    - 6 navel oranges, cut into quarter-wheels
    - 6 lemons, cut into half-wheels
    - 3 limes, cut into wheels
    - 1 pint fresh raspberries
    - 1 pineapple, cut into 1-inch cubes
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle Plymouth gin
    - 1¾ cups freshly squeezed lemon juice
    - 1¼ cups simple syrup
    - ½ cup orgeat or almond syrup
    - 1 cup Massenez crème de framboise
    - 3 cups water
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle Perrier-Jouët Grand Brut champagne
    steps:
    - Prepare the decorative ice block, allowing a few hours for freezing.
    - Combine all the fruits in a large punch bowl. 
    - Add the gin, juice, syrups, crème de framboise, and water. 
    - Refrigerate for at least 4 to 5 hours. 
    - Just before serving, add the champagne and the decorative ice block.

  - name: Spiced Sangria Roja
    author: 
    notes: This is our favorite sangria recipe–it involves a little more effort than the usual sangria, but its flavor is far more complex than just wine mixed with orange juice. It really should be enjoyed with food, preferably tap as and small plates. It is an excellent companion to cheese and fish as well. Makes 2 quarts.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 cups water
    - 1 cup sugar
    - 2 whole cloves
    - 2 cinnamon sticks
    - 2 star anise
    - 1 vanilla pod, split
    - 3 thin slices fresh ginger
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle Rioja or dry Spanish red wine
    - 1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
    - ⅛ cup freshly squeezed lime juice
    - 1 orange, cut into quarter-wheels
    - 1 lemon, cut into wheels
    - 1 cup seeded and cubed honeydew melon
    - 1 cup red grapes, halved
    steps:
    - In a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the water, sugar, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, vanilla pod, and ginger. 
    - Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes. 
    - Turn off the heat and let sit for 30 minutes to infuse. Strain into a large bowl. 
    - Add the wine, juices, and fruits and stir well. 
    - Refrigerate overnight. 
    - Serve from pitchers over lots of ice.

    author: 
    notes: White Sangria is something you really want in the summertime when nothing is going on and it’s hot and very humid outside. We developed this recipe about six years ago and have loved it ever since. Highly suggested for afternoon gatherings and finger foods. Makes 2½ quarts.
