    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - ⅜ ounce 3:1 honey syrup
    - ⅜ ounce ginger syrup
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ¼ ounce smoky Scotch, preferably Laphroaig 10
    - 1¾ ounce apple brandy, preferably Laird's Straight Bottled-in-Bond
    - Mist of Angostura bitters from a spray bottle
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients except Angostura bitters in a cocktail shaker.
    - Add ice, then shake until chilled, about 10-12 seconds. 
    - Strain into a rocks glass over a single large piece of ice. 
    - Using a small spray bottle, spray a mist layer of Angostura onto the top of the drink. (If you don't have a mist bottle, simply take a scant barspoon of Angostura bitters and very gently pour it over the top of the drink. You're trying to float a very, very fine layer of bitters at the top of the mix.)
