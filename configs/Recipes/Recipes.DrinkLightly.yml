#Gulpable Thirst Quenchers
  - name: Pinkies Out
    notes: Well, this is THE drink, the one that started this whole crazy journey, the inspired by but totally not White Wine Spritz. This cocktail was created for Nitecap’s inaugural menu. I had set up a wine tasting with one of our reps who specialized in eastern European wines, and one sip of an unctuous, dry Slovenian bottle had me immediately thinking about putting it in a cocktail. The wine reminded me a lot of Lillet; with a floral nose and honey-like finish, it was begging to be spritzified. I know there are a lot of wine people rolling their eyes right now, but trust me, this cocktail is an homage to the wine, its maker, and my mother, and you don’t want to insult my mother, right?!
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces dry orange wine
    - 1 ounce Cocchi Americano Bianco
    - 1 ounce Chamomile Blanc Vermouth
    - ½ ounce white verjus
    - Dry hard sparkling cider, to top
    - "Garnish: orange crescent"
    steps:
    - Combine the orange wine, Cocchi Americano, chamomile-infused vermouth, and verjus in a wine glass filled with 3 hand-cracked ice cubes. Add more ice. Top with the hard cider. Stir to chill and incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with an orange crescent.

    notes: I’m one of those people who dreads winter. Yeah, yeah, snow is pretty, but I’d never willingly go play in it. That’s what sand is for. But sitting by the fireplace is so romantic. (You know what’s more romantic than sitting by a fireplace in a fleece pajama set? Sitting on a beach, topless, with sweat beads glistening on my bronzed skin as the sun shines down on me with all her glory.) I’ll give winter one thing, though—citrus season. Ah, yes, the time of year when bright-hued Meyer lemons make regular old lemons hide with shame, when it’s not just grapefruits but also pomelos and flame grapefruits. And, of course, the mighty blood orange in all its stain-inducing power. Besides being glorious to look at, it is beautifully sweet and possesses an intoxicating, almost overripe, raspberry taste. This recipe is built around highlighting all of the blood orange’s gorgeous qualities.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces full-bodied sweet vermouth
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce fresh blood orange juice
    - ½ ounce Cacao Nib Campari
    - ½ ounce Vanilla Syrup
    - "Garnish: Blood orange crescent and lemon wheel"
    steps:
    - Combine the sweet vermouth, lemon juice, blood orange juice, cacao-infused Campari, and syrup in a shaker. Add ice and give it a short shake. Strain into a double rocks glass over crushed ice. Top with more ice and snow-cone it. Garnish with a blood orange crescent and lemon wheel. Serve with a straw.

    notes: This is basically like the best adult soda you’ve ever had. I grew up in a home where it was all health food all the time. While other kids in elementary school got cookies in their lunch boxes, I got licorice sticks. And I’m not talking about chewy, sweet licorice Twizzlers; I’m talking literal sticks, like branches from a licorice tree. Yeah, I was the biracial kid chewing on a stick. It went great (Mom—I know you had the best intentions!). So, you can imagine how little soda we drank. I got one Coca-Cola on my birthday, one Shirley Temple when we went to our favorite Chinese restaurant when we visited my grandmother each year, and one root beer float to accompany burgers at our yearly pilgrimage to Smokehouse. I treated that root beer float as if God had presented herself to me in drink form. To this day, an ice-cold root beer, preferably over a mountain of crushed ice, is my favorite soda treat. But now I’m a big girl, so here is my adult version of soda.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Suze apéritif
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Honey Syrup
    - 2 drops root beer extract
    - Bubbly water, to top
    - "Garnish: Lemon wedge"
    steps:
    - Combine the Suze, lemon juice, syrup, and root beer extract in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a highball glass over cubed ice. Top with the bubbly water. Give the drink a quick stir to incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with a lemon wedge. Serve with a straw.
    - "Caution: Although it may seem tempting to just sub in some root beer soda from the deli downstairs, this drink won’t be the same! The combination of bubbly water + root beer extract has the opposite effect of soda pop—it’s supremely dry—thus making this drink refreshing and chuggable."

    notes: I was first introduced to aquavit when I joined the opening team of Vandaag, an ambitious Scandinavian restaurant with one of the best, in my humble opinion, bar programs ever created. At the helm of the bar was Katie Stipe, a true mentor and now dear friend. I hadn’t ever given aquavit much thought before, but Katie’s application of it made me see it in a whole new light. Now, I have a lot of feelings about aquavit—adoration, love, obsession, to name a few. It’s bright yet also intensely earthy and can be dressed up to look either very serious or playful and carefree. As the flavor profile of aquavit is very bold, it needs equally intense flavors to play with, and so I immediately reached for my bottle of carrot eau de vie. Oh, you don’t have a bottle of carrot eau de vie lying around? Well, you should, because it’s magic in a bottle. Each sip of carrot eau de vie takes you on a literal journey of eating a carrot that’s been freshly plucked from the ground—you get the dirt, the bitterness of the carrot tops, and the sweet almost candy-like flavor of the flesh.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Lillet Rosé
    - ¾ ounce unaged aquavit (preferably Krogstad)
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Pomegranate Grenadine
    - 1 teaspoon Honey Syrup
    - 1 teaspoon Reisetbauer carrot eau de vie
    - Dry sparkling rosé, to top
    - "Garnish: Lemon twist"
    steps:
    - Combine the Lillet Rosé, aquavit, lemon juice, pomegranate grenadine, syrup, and carrot eau de vie in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a coupe glass. Top with the sparkling rosé. Garnish with an expressed lemon twist.

    notes: Call me crazy, but whenever I’m drinking an Aperol Spritz, I want to eat a beet salad. Also (and the Italians are going to ban me from their country for this), I want to garnish my Aperol Spritz with a grapefruit crescent rather than the recommended orange slice. Why? Because my palate craves bright, bitter, juicy citrus with the bittersweet voluptuous qualities of Aperol. To balance everything out, I picked pisco for its beautiful fragrant bouquet and to add a little je ne sais quoi. I’ll be the first to admit that this drink reads strange, but trust me, it’s a flavorful and nuanced sour. Yes, it requires a little more prep work than other recipes, but the result is worth it. Plus, you can always repurpose your bottle of beet-infused Aperol for a next-level Aperol Spritz.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Beet Aperol
    - ¾ ounce fresh grapefruit juice
    - ¾ ounce Raspberry Syrup
    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ½ ounce pisco
    - "Garnish: grapefruit crescent"
    steps:
    - Combine the beet-infused Aperol, grapefruit juice, syrup, lime juice, and pisco in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a double rocks glass with large-format ice. Garnish with a grapefruit crescent.

    notes: "If a cocktail could be a season, this one would be that little sliver in time at the end of summer: it’s still sort of warm during the day, but a few leaves are starting to change color. You decided to cook your dinner on the grill, and finally, after months of sweating while manning the BBQ, you are perfectly comfortable, but once the sun sets, you have to put on a sweater. So, it’s an homage to the almost too ripe fig that you’ve sneakily plucked from your neighbors (hey, the branch was technically on your property line) and the promise of ripe pears to come. And even though there is no single ingredient that is smoky, collectively this combination somehow ends up tasting toasty and grilled."
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Lillet Rouge
    - ¾ ounce Bonal Gentiane-Quina
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Pomegranate Grenadine
    - 1 teaspoon unaged pear brandy (preferably Clear Creek)
    - 1 heaping barspoon of fig preserves
    - "Garnish: Pear fan on a cocktail pick"
    steps:
    - Combine the Lillet Rouge, Bonal, lemon juice, pomegranate grenadine, pear brandy, and fig preserves in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a double rocks glass with large-format ice. Garnish with a pear fan on a cocktail pick.

    notes: A Whiskey Highball and a Vermouth and Soda walk into a bar, fall in love, and elope to a tropical island. That’s my sales pitch for this drink. But if you want to get a bit more in depth, I came up with this drink during my coconut obsession phase. I was deep into it at this point and wanted to make a Madeira Piña Colada, which never quite worked out, but I did discover that the flavor combination of madeira and coconut was a delightful one. The madeira here is infused with toasted coconut flakes, which also automatically gives the delicate wine more body, making it perfect for shaking up in a cocktail.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Toasted Coconut Madeira
    - 1 ounce Salted Lemon-Lime Cordial
    - ½ ounce bourbon
    - ½ ounce fresh pineapple juice
    - Bubbly water, to top
    - "Garnish: pineapple wedge"
    steps:
    - Combine the toasted coconut–infused madeira, lemon-lime cordial, bourbon, and pineapple juice in a shaker. Add ice and give it a short shake. Strain into a highball glass with cubed ice. Top with the bubbly water. Stir to incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with a pineapple wedge. Serve with a straw.

    notes: There is something insanely delicious about just-juiced carrot juice. Specifically, just-juiced carrot juice poured over a mountain of crushed ice. The flavor is intensely earthy with a hint of delectable sweetness. It’s also slightly bitter, so it really just gets your taste buds working. I usually stay clear of cocktails I call “salad cocktails,” that is, cocktails that have muddled this and muddled that and this herb and that herb and the juice of this vegetable and that vegetable. I guess you could say I overcame my own prejudice, and this is my version of a salad cocktail, completely making carrot juice the star.
    ingredients:
    - 2 seedless cucumber slices
    - 1½ ounces Pimm’s
    - 1½ ounces fresh carrot juice
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Aperol
    - ¼ ounce Ginger Syrup
    - 1 teaspoon Simple Syrup
    - 1 dash absinthe
    - "Garnish: Cucumber slice (seedless), lavish mint bouquet, and cocktail umbrella"
    steps:
    - Muddle the 2 cucumber slices at the bottom of a shaker. Add the Pimm’s, carrot juice,  lemon juice, Aperol, ginger syrup, simple syrup, and absinthe to the shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a festive glass filled three-quarters with crushed ice. Top with more crushed ice and snow-cone it. Garnish with cucumber slice, lavish mint bouquet, and cocktail umbrella. Serve with a straw.

    notes: This is a highball that gives you a little joyful shiver. The inspiration was the Gin and Tonic, and before you say anything, I know there is neither gin nor tonic in this recipe. This drink is kind of like method acting, a sensory experience guided by memory. Okay, I feel like I might be losing you, but stick with me. You’re in a nightclub, the music is so loud you can feel it vibrating in your feet, there’s strobe lights, you’re sweaty, and your drink is empty. You make it up to the bar, the bartender is slammed, you want something refreshing, so you order a Gin and Tonic. The first sip is kind of overwhelming because it seems like you just took a huge gulp of gin and your tongue sort of tingles and feels a little numb, but in a pleasant way. A few sips in, the ingredients have mixed together and mellowed out. Yuzu does that same thing for me, and I love it!
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce manzanilla sherry
    - ½ ounce Suze apéritif
    - ½ ounce unaged pear brandy (preferably Clear Creek)
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Simple Syrup
    - Sparkling yuzu sake, to top
    - "Garnish: Long lemon twist"
    steps:
    - Combine the sherry, Suze, pear brandy, lemon juice, and syrup in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a highball glass filled with cubed ice. Top with the sparkling yuzu sake. Stir to incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with a long expressed lemon twist. Serve with a straw.

    notes: To me, the third date was always the “all right, I’m definitely into you, I thought about what to wear since our last date, now tell me some of your dirty secrets and let’s see if there is still a spark” date. In other words, you need a drink that (1) keeps you on your toes (you might need to run), (2) has some comforting flavors (exposing deep truths about yourself is scary), and (3) is delicious (because). So, cheers to your dating life and the utter craziness that is dating in the twenty-first century, and hopefully you want to make sweet, sweet love to this drink all night long.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces sweet vermouth (preferably Carpano Antica)
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce sour cherry liqueur (preferably American Fruit Sour Cherry)
    - ½ ounce Cinnamon Syrup
    - ¼ ounce Ancho Reyes Ancho Chile Liqueur
    - "Garnish: Lemon wheel and cherry flag (see this page)"
    steps:
    - Combine the sweet vermouth, lemon juice, cherry liqueur, syrup, and Ancho Reyes in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a double rocks glass with large-format ice. Garnish  with a lemon wheel and cherry flag.

    notes: This drink is beautifully simple and is all about the glorious strawberry. The cocktail calls for only half of a muddled strawberry, which may seem like so little, but this mighty berry is bursting with flavor. Another reason I can get away with using so little actual strawberry in this drink is because all the other ingredients bring out the strawberry-ness of that one little half. The Lillet Rosé is delicate and nuanced and reminds me of the stems and tops of a strawberry where there might still be a tiny bit of green. Amaro Ramazzotti, on the other hand, is deep and rich, voluptuous and ripe. And any strawberry worth talking about is equally as tart as it is sweet, thus the choice of lemon juice and a neutral sweetener such as simple syrup.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Lillet Rosé
    - ¾ ounce Amaro Ramazzotti
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Simple Syrup
    - Bubbly water, to top
    - "Garnish: 1/2 strawberry"
    steps:
    - Lightly muddle the ½ strawberry at the bottom of a shaker. Add the Lillet Rosé, Ramazzotti, lemon juice, and syrup to the shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a highball glass with cubed ice. Top with the bubbly water. Stir to incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with the remaining strawberry half. Serve with a straw.

    notes: A Rum and Coke is just so gloriously delicious sometimes. When I get that intense, albeit rare, craving for an ice-cold, bubbly, vanilla-y, cinnamon-y Coke, nothing can satisfy me until I get that first gulp of sugary goodness. After a few sips I usually feel like I’ve been hit over the head, so I wanted to soften the blow when I translated this love into cocktail form. This drink uses cola extract in place of its soda counterpart, so the final product has all the flavors of that nostalgic sip but in its purest form and minus the headache. I also opted not to top this cocktail with seltzer and instead gave it a rich texture by way of fresh pineapple juice.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Cola Lustau Rosé Vermut
    - ¾ ounce fresh pineapple juice
    - ½ ounce Singani (preferably Singani 63)
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ¼ ounce maraschino liqueur (preferably Caffo)
    - ¼ ounce Simple Syrup
    - "Garnish: Pineapple wedge"
    steps:
    - Combine the Cola Lustau Rosé Vermut, pineapple juice, Singani, lemon juice, maraschino liqueur, and syrup in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a double rocks glass with large-format ice. Garnish with a pineapple wedge.

    notes: There is a very ill-named cocktail called the Mexican Firing Squad. While the name leaves much to be desired, the actual drink is outrageously tasty. I love this drink so much that we served it at our wedding. And let me tell you, we had a dance party of such epic proportions that I’m amazed no one fainted in the August heat of New York City. It was a sweaty lovefest, and I was grateful my wedding dress was short and backless. But for many of the party revelers, the day that followed was a hangover of epic proportions. So now, years later, this is my “thank you and sorry” to all my wedding guests—a truly chuggable version of its boozy predecessor.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Neversink Apple Apéritif
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Jalapeño Blanco Tequila
    - ½ ounce Pomegranate Grenadine
    - 3 dashes Angostura bitters
    - Bubbly water, to top
    - "Garnish: Lime wedge"
    steps:
    - Combine the Neversink, lemon juice, Jalapeño Blanco Tequila, pomegranate grenadine, and Angostura bitters in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a highball glass with cubed ice. Top with the bubbly water. Stir to incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with a lime wedge. Serve with a straw.

    notes: Like I’ve mentioned before, I’m always on a quest to spread the sherry love. As a loyal fan of the classic Bamboo cocktail (we had an adapted version of it on draft at Nitecap since day one), I wanted to present the drink in a less serious format while still maintaining and honoring its core recipe. Enter my brilliant husband, Jeremy, who some consider the slushy king. He said, “Wouldn’t it be funny if you turned the Bamboo into a slushy?” I indeed thought it was a hilarious idea (bartenders have a weird sense of humor). In transforming the Bamboo, I was inspired by a trio of iconic blended cocktails—the Piña Colada, Margarita, and fruit Daiquiri. While this drink is most certainly perfect for an extra-hot day, it is also transportive during those long snowy winters.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces amontillado sherry
    - 1 ounce Simple Syrup
    - ¾ ounce white vermouth
    - ¾ ounce dry vermouth
    - ¾ ounce fresh orange juice
    - ½ ounce strawberry puree
    - ¼ ounce banana rum
    - "Garnish: Paper parasol, edible flower, and disco dust"
    steps:
    - Combine the sherry, syrup, white vermouth, dry vermouth, orange juice, strawberry puree, and banana rum in a blender with ½ cup of crushed ice. Blend on high for 15 to 20 seconds and pour into a double rocks glass. Garnish with paper parasol, edible flower, and disco dust. Serve with a straw but make sure it’s not metal to avoid a lip-stuck-to-straw disaster!
    - "Note: If you can’t find strawberry puree, use 2 whole strawberries, fresh or frozen, with an extra ¼ ounce simple syrup in its place."

    notes: The simple yet enchanting mixture of lemonade and beer is one I’ve been sipping on for years. It’s a fantastic way to elongate the already low-ABV beer into a truly sessionable beverage best accompanied by a burger and fries. It is no secret that the mixture of hops and citrus makes for a delightful pairing. Although this combination originally hails from Germany, I opted for a Belgian-style wheat beer to get that extra dose of hazy lemon. This cocktail is best enjoyed when served cold cold cold, so it should be drunk efficiently and refilled on the regular.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Aperitivo Cappelletti
    - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ½ ounce Pineapple Gum Syrup
    - ¼ ounce Giffard Fruit de la Passion Liqueur
    - Belgian-style wheat beer, to top
    - "Garnish: Lime wedge"
    steps:
    - Combine the Cappelletti, lime juice, pineapple gum syrup, and passion fruit liqueur in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a highball glass with no ice and top with the Belgian wheat beer. Garnish with a lime wedge.

    notes: The Pimm’s Cup—a refreshing cooler traditionally served with citrus, fresh fruit, and ginger ale—is as delightful as it sounds. But it’s also a little prim and proper and flesh-colored pantyhose-y. It’s what aristocrats drink while watching a tennis match or taking evening strolls in their perfectly manicured gardens while their children play with the nanny, all wearing matching outfits. I mean, that’s lovely and all, but I’m already yawning. So this version is a little grittier. In place of sugary ginger ale, we use a syrup made from fresh ginger, making it earthy, spicy, and deep. I’ve added a spoonful of blueberry preserves to coat your mouth and linger gloriously. Bubbles take form in Lambrusco, and I urge you to seek out a dry one, maybe even natural, to give it an added layer of funky vibez.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Contratto Aperitif
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce sloe gin
    - ½ ounce Ginger Syrup
    - 1 tablespoon blueberry preserves (preferably Bonne Maman)
    - Dry Lambrusco wine, to top
    - "Garnish: Lemon wheel, mint bouquet, and fresh blueberries"
    steps:
    - Combine the Contratto Aperitif, lemon juice, sloe gin, ginger syrup, and blueberry preserves in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a highball glass over cubed ice. Top with Lambrusco. Stir to incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with a lemon wheel, mint bouquet, and fresh blueberries. Serve with a straw.

    notes: This highball is all about comfort and nostalgia. While sage is said to ward off evil spirits, it also has an immediate calming effect on me (perhaps because it wards off evil spirits). On the nose, it always reminds me of eucalyptus with a spritz of fresh lemon oil, warm and inviting, while also having an unexpected edge, a rawness. It’s sort of like a rugged mountain man with a sensitive side. To calm the slight bitterness in the sage, I chose honey, and the combination creates a wonderful, almost fuzzy sensation on the tongue. That, along with the bubbles from the tonic water, make this serious-on-paper cocktail much more youthful.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Sage White Wine
    - ¼ ounce Honey Syrup
    - ½ teaspoon apricot liqueur
    - 2 dashes Miracle Mile Bay Rum Bitters
    - Tonic water, to top
    - "Garnish: Lemon wheel and dried bay leaf"
    steps:
    - Combine the sage-infused white wine, syrup, apricot liqueur, and bitters in a wine glass with 3 hand-cracked ice cubes. Add more ice. Top with tonic water. Stir to chill and incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with a lemon wheel and dried bay leaf.

    notes: Celery is a truly an underappreciated vegetable. It gets painstakingly chopped into fine delicate pieces by cooks to be braised and sautéed with little regard from the eater, who just cares about the short rib. It’s the vegetable left sitting lonely on the crudités platter; the garnish that gets violently ripped out of the Bloody Mary, abandoned on the table at the end of the meal along with the dirty napkins and check presenter. So I implore you, go get yourself a celery stick, break it in half, and take a good, deep whiff of its inviting, cooling, and crisp smell. Now take a bite. There’s that initial satisfying crunch, which is quickly followed by a wave of vegetal yet sweet water. It’s truly a glorious vegetable bursting with flavor, and this cocktail celebrates it. And please, don’t forget the garnish on this one! It’s there for a reason.…
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces White Floc de Gascogne
    - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ½ ounce St. Germain elderflower liqueur
    - ½ ounce Celery Syrup
    - Bubbly water, to top
    - "Garnish: Celery ribbon"
    steps:
    - Combine the Floc de Gascogne, lime juice, St. Germain, and syrup in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a highball glass over cubed ice. Top with the bubbly water. Stir to incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with a celery ribbon. Serve with a straw.

    notes: Amaretto has an undeserved bad reputation. Once mixed into an Amaretto Sour, it’s the cocktail of choice of sorority houses. And honestly that’s not even a sting against sorority houses, but aimed at the makers of sour mix from a soda gun, which causes this drink to become a sugary, mouth-numbing hangover from hell. I, like many other people, swore off this drink, until one day, the Goddess of Balance showed me the way. Fresh juice from an actual lemon replaced sour mix and was properly balanced with not only the simple syrup but the inherently sugary amaretto. I guess you could say I’ve rekindled my romance with this massively misunderstood liqueur.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Vermouth Limoncello
    - 1 ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce amaretto (preferably Caffo)
    - ½ ounce Simple Syrup
    - 1 dash absinthe
    - 1 organic egg white
    - "Garnish: Expressed then discarded lemon twist and Angostura bitters swirl"
    steps:
    - Combine the vermouth limoncello, lemon juice, amaretto, syrup, absinthe, and egg white in a shaker. Pre-shake without ice. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a coupe glass. Express a lemon twist over the cocktail then discard. Garnish with a swirl of Angostura bitters.

    notes: Cocktails with red wine are often related back to sangría. It’s a very democratic cocktail, shared among friends with different likes and dislikes, poured out of a communal pitcher, often enjoyed during a family-style meal. It’s an easy cocktail, almost too easy. So, well, I wanted to complicate things a bit and stir sh*t up. Hello, green Chartreuse! The recipe calls for only a quarter ounce of this pungent, wild herbal liqueur that dates back centuries, but boy, does it make an impact. When combined with rich, dark crème de cassis, you’ll kind of feel like you are getting away with something, and let me tell you, it feels good.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces full-bodied red wine
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce crème de cassis
    - ½ ounce Simple Syrup
    - ¼ ounce green Chartreuse
    - "Garnish: Brandied cherries"
    steps:
    - Combine the red wine, lemon juice, crème de cassis, syrup, and Chartreuse in a shaker. Add ice and give it a short shake. Strain into a wine glass over cubed ice. Garnish with brandied cherries.

    notes: This cocktail is inspired by my dear friend Lauren Corriveau, who was once my right-hand wing-woman at Nitecap. Additionally, Lauren might like French fries more than I do. There have been times when Lauren and I visited multiple bars in one night and ordered French fries at each along the way, for comparison’s sake, you know. Research. Lauren has this ability to take flavors that I personally think sound pretty muddy together and magically turn them into the most delicious drinks ever. I think it’s one of her many superpowers. One such flavor combination was a cocktail with red bell pepper juice and raspberry. In my mind it sounded terrible! But I would pretty much follow Lauren into a burning building, so I took a tiny sip, followed by another sip, followed by another. I couldn’t put it down. It was so unbelievably good! This is an homage of sorts, with a double dose of raspberry taking the form of a syrup and a preserve.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces H&H Rainwater Madeira
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce fresh red bell pepper juice
    - ½ ounce Martini & Rossi Fiero
    - ½ ounce Raspberry Syrup
    - 1 heaping barspoon of raspberry preserves
    - "Garnish: 3 speared raspberries"
    steps:
    - Combine the madeira, lemon juice, red bell pepper juice, Martini & Rossi Fiero, syrup, and raspberry preserves in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a double rocks glass over large-format ice. Garnish with 3 raspberries on a pick.

    notes: There are a lot of strong players in this drink, and at first glance I get that it might seem a little overwhelming. But surprisingly, this drink is a pretty easygoing, vegetal refresher. It kind of hits your body in the way biting into a Popsicle does, and you feel it all the way from your toes to your head. Pastis has this incredible cooling effect that sort of takes you out of your body. Cachaça, usually a free spirit, plays an uncharacteristic role in this formula as the grounding force. Together they lift the bright green, clean, crisp notes of the bell pepper. Lime peel is intensely fragrant, so by adding it directly to your drink, you infuse an entire dimension of flavor. You get texture, bitterness, and an almost piney quality that complements the pastis—like glitter on the dance floor.
    ingredients:
    - 4 juicy lime wedges
    - 1 ounce Carpano Bianco vermouth
    - 1 ounce Green Bell Pepper Syrup
    - ½ ounce pastis
    - ½ ounce unaged cachaça
    - "Garnish: Lime wedge"
    steps:
    - At the bottom of a shaker, muddle the 4 lime wedges. Add the Carpano Bianco, green bell pepper syrup, pastis, and cachaça. Add ice and shake vigorously. Pour the contents of the shaker into a double rocks glass. Top with more ice if needed. Garnish with a lime wedge. Serve with a straw.

    notes: Oh, Thai basil, how I love thee! Unlike Genovese basil, also known as Italian basil, the Thai variety has notes of anise and even a slight bit of spice. I was first introduced to Thai basil–infused blanc vermouth while working behind the bar at Mayahuel, an agave mecca. Already an avid fan of blanc vermouth (it’s my go-to in a simple one-and-one highball), the addition of this fragrant and savory herb blew me away. Its presence was undeniable, and even though it has intense flavors, it didn’t take away from all the delicate floral notes in the vermouth. In fact, it seemed to enhance them. This cocktail is dry, vegetal, and overwhelmingly thirst quenching. Be prepared to drink more than one.
    ingredients:
    - 1 seedless cucumber slice
    - 1 ounce fino sherry
    - 1 ounce Thai Basil Blanc Vermouth
    - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ½ ounce Salted Cane Syrup
    - "Garnish: Salt rim and cucumber slice (seedless)"
    steps:
    - At the bottom of a shaker, lightly muddle the cucumber slice. Add the fino sherry, Thai basil–infused vermouth, lime juice, and syrup to the shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a salt-rimmed double rocks glass over large-format ice. Garnish with a cucumber slice.

    notes: August in New York City. It’s the muggiest, sweatiest, why-do-I-have-to-wear-clothes-to-work kind of hot. It’s depressing, it’s suffocating, and it feels like there is no relief…until…you walk past a fire hydrant propelling a cool shower of rain into the sky. As it hits your skin, you feel renewed, even if for just that brief moment. All at once there’s a little hop and skip in your walk, and getting to your next appointment doesn’t feel all that awful anymore.… This drink does all that.
    ingredients:
    - 2 shiso leaves	
    - 3 ounces fresh watermelon juice
    - 1½ ounces yuzu sake
    - "Garnish: Shiso leaf"
    steps:
    - At the bottom of a highball glass, lightly muddle 2 shiso leaves. Add cubed ice and pour in the watermelon juice and yuzu sake. Gently stir to combine. Garnish with a shiso leaf delicately tucked behind the ice. Serve with a straw.

    notes: "Never ever in my life have I thought about, ordered, or craved iced tea. Until I’m at someone’s house and they offer it to me. Then I will accept the glass without much fanfare, take a sip, and exclaim, “Why on earth don’t I drink this supremely delicious and refreshing beverage more often?” And then somehow another year passes without another iced tea. When I started conceptualizing this book, I wrote myself a reminder: Iced tea is your friend. So here it is. My slightly spiked, smoky, cherry pit, marzipan, peachy, cooler iced tea."
    ingredients:

      - 2 ounces Maurin Quina
      - 1 teaspoon peach liqueur
      - "Garnish: 3 lemon wheels"

    notes: Originally hailing from a coffee shop named Koppi in Sweden, the Coffee and Tonic is a mixture of cold brew coffee and tonic water served over ice. It has amassed a loyal, if not almost cultlike, following in the US. I’ll be honest, when I first heard of this combination, I may have gagged a little. But then I reminded myself to remain open-minded, and after finally trying one, yup, I agreed—it was simply delicious! One version I gleefully slurped was garnished with a Luxardo maraschino cherry, and it was that combination that inspired this cocktail. Honestly, this is one of my favorite recipes in this collection of many, and I’d love for you to just stop reading and make one for yourself, so please, don’t let me stand in your way.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces umeshu
    - 1 ounce cold brew coffee
    - ½ ounce oloroso sherry
    - Tonic water, to top
    - "Garnish: Plum fan"
    steps:
    - Combine the umeshu, coffee, sherry, and tonic water in a highball glass filled with cubed ice. Stir to incorporate ingredients. Garnish with a plum fan. Serve with a straw.

    notes: One of my all-time favorite “tricks” is adding a teaspoon of peated scotch whiskey to tart and juicy cocktails. Few things make such a big impact in such a small package. It adds a completely unexpected layer of flavor without hijacking the rest of the ingredients. I always think of it as a sort of wink at the end of a story, a little secret between my closest inner circle and myself. Here, the small pour of scotch, or as I like to call it smoky honey juice, is accompanied by a minuscule pour of potent, lush, and almost candy-like peach liqueur, creating a combination so highbrow/lowbrow, I almost can’t stand it. This cocktail is for my sister, Alma, who I feel like would read this list of ingredients and be tickled. So here is my almost, maybe kind of tropical, but not really, dry sherry refresher.	
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces amontillado sherry
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Pineau des Charantes
    - ½ ounce Cinnamon Syrup
    - ¼ ounce peach liqueur
    - 1 teaspoon peated scotch whiskey
    - "Garnish: Lemon wheel and brandied cherry flag"
    steps:
    - Combine the sherry, lemon juice, Pineau des Charantes, syrup, peach liqueur, and scotch in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a double rocks glass with large-format ice. Garnish with a lemon wheel and brandied cherry flag.

    notes: Honestly, this cocktail is all about making you feel giddy. A double dose of tartness makes you scrunch your nose. And I can’t really think of anything more delicious than pineapples soaked in all the roasty juices of mezcal. There’s something about this combination that just oozes eternal youth, open roads, messy hair, ripped jeans (from being lived in, not from some designer slashing them open and charging you more), and a life without alarm clocks.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Cocchi Americano Bianco
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Pineapple Mezcal
    - ½ ounce Simple Syrup
    - 1 teaspoon mango vinegar
    steps:
    - Combine the Cocchi Americano, lemon juice, pineapple-infused mezcal, syrup, and mango vinegar in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a coupe glass. No garnish.

    notes: "Spazieren is a German word that, like many German words, is very specific but doesn’t quite have an English equivalent. Spazieren means to take a walk, but it’s not just a walk, it’s more of a stroll, one you take out of pure enjoyment and ideally in nature, like in a forest. I haven’t been back to Germany in a long time to be able to check ye old walk in the Black Forest off my bucket list yet, so in its place I made a cocktail inspired by what I imagine this walk would be like. And the garnish is important: three, yes, precisely three, brandied cherries, to be delicately eaten, one by one, making sure to save one cherry for that perfect final sip."
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Carpano Antica sweet vermouth
    - ¾ ounce rye whiskey
    - ¼ ounce unaged cherry brandy
    - ½ teaspoon Branca Menta
    - 1 dash absinthe
    - "Garnish: 3 speared brandied cherries"
    steps:
    - Combine the sweet vermouth, rye whiskey, cherry brandy, Branca Menta, and absinthe in a chilled mixing glass. Add ice and stir. Strain into a Nick and Nora glass. Garnish with 3 brandied cherries on a cocktail pick.

    notes: There is nothing traditional about this cocktail. Yes, it’s somewhat reminiscent of a classic Martini, but even its barely pale green color suggests that you have signed yourself up for something a little out of the ordinary. The bright, crisp heat of a jalapeño is a natural friend of the almost musky and juicy mango, but throw in a flowering, earthy bouquet of alpine herbs, and you’ll find yourself in a threesome you never knew you wanted or needed.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces white vermouth
    - ¾ ounce Jalapeño Blanco Tequila
    - ½ ounce génépi
    - 1 teaspoon Rhine Hall mango brandy
    steps:
    - Combine the white vermouth, jalapeño-infused tequila, génépi, and mango brandy in a chilled mixing glass. Add ice and stir. Strain into a Nick and Nora glass.

    notes: This cocktail is very clearly inspired by the formidable Negroni—a drink that I adore and have a hard time turning down. But the Negroni is not for the faint of heart (or for those who accidentally drink on an empty stomach), as it packs a punch. Here is my version that is meant to make you slow down and nonchalantly play footsie with your new flame.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces fino sherry
    - 1 ounce Cocchi Americano Rosa
    - ½ ounce Cacao Nib Campari
    - 1 heaping bar spoon of cherry preserves
    - "Garnish: Orange wheel"

    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces amontillado sherry
    - 1½ ounces Cocchi Americano Rosa
    - 1 dash orange bitters
    - 1 dash grapefruit bitters
    - "Garnish: Grapefruit twist"

    notes: I call this a segue cocktail, a cocktail to bridge the gap between two different styles. It may sound crazy, but think of this drink as a sort of hybrid Martini Sour (did I just blow your mind!?). If you lean toward shaken refreshing drinks but want to dip your toes into the stirred cocktail world, this might be the gentle transition you are looking for. It’s juicy yet rich. It’s tart yet silky. The combination of pommeau and Cocchi Americano creates an apple flavor that’s ripe and crunchy yet somehow caramelized and baked. Throw in a little tropical surprise by way of passion fruit and you’ve got yourself the perfect intro to a cocktail that makes you ponder and dig a little deeper.	
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces pommeau
    - 1 ounce Cocchi Americano Bianco
    - ½ ounce white verjus
    - 1 teaspoon Giffard Fruit de la Passion Liqueur
    - 1 dash orange bitters
    - "Garnish: Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Combine the pommeau, Cocchi Americano, verjus, passion fruit liqueur, and orange bitters in a chilled mixing glass. Add ice and stir. Strain into a Nick and Nora glass. Garnish with an expressed orange twist.

    notes: If I were to suggest a food pairing in this book, it would be to accompany this cocktail with a scoop of rich, creamy vanilla ice cream. And I’m going to get a bit snobby for a second here. I’m not talking Breyer’s. I’m talking decadent Tahitian vanilla ice cream. You know, the kind where you’re in the ice cream aisle, staring at all your options, and one tub costs $2.99 while the other costs $8.99 and you’re like, “But it’s just vanilla ice cream. How much better can one be than the other?!” And have I told you all about my love of combining aged apple brandy with aquavit before? Because it’s an important love that I feel in every limb of my body. When combined, they basically make a cookie. And if I haven’t managed to sell you on this cocktail yet, even after mentioning pie, ice cream, and cookies, then I’m not sure if I’m qualified to endorse anything ever again.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Pineau des Charantes
    - ¾ ounce Cocchi Americano Bianco
    - ½ ounce aged apple brandy
    - ½ ounce aged aquavit (preferably Linie)
    - Absinthe, to rinse glass
    - "Garnish: Lemon twist, discarded"
    steps:
    - Combine the Pineau des Charantes, Cocchi Americano, apple brandy, and aged aquavit in a chilled mixing glass. Add ice and stir. Strain into an absinthe-rinsed, chilled single rocks glass. For garnish, express a lemon twist into the glass and discard the peel.

    notes: What I love about an Old-Fashioned is that it transforms over time. Your first sip can almost take you by surprise. It’s sharp. It’s biting. But with each sip, you can see corners turning into rounded edges. When I started thinking about creating a low-ABV version of this iconic cocktail, I wanted it to take you on the same kind of journey. Imagine this cocktail as a conversation about a rather heated topic. There may be conflict at first, but by the end, there is some sort of resolution, a coming together. And hopefully the drink helped.

    notes: Out of all of the cocktails in this book, I’d say that this is the most serious. Maybe that’s just because we all have this preconceived notion that Cognac is very fancy-pants, which, yeah, okay, it is, but fancy shouldn’t mean inaccessible. This recipe calls for a tiny measure of that good stuff, which gives the sherry and vermouth that extra va-va-voom factor. I'm not a cigar smoking kind of girl, but if I were, I would, with 100 percent certainty, pair my mighty puffing stick with this beverage. I’d also like to point out that this is one of those drinks where glassware makes an impact. The double rocks glass you choose for this should ideally have a heavy base, perhaps made of (faux) crystal, and feel sturdy. Basically, you’ll instantly become very important.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce oloroso sherry	
    - ¾ ounce amber vermouth
    - ½ ounce Pedro Ximénez sherry
    - ½ ounce cognac
    - 1 teaspoon coffee liqueur
    - "Garnish: Orange twist"

    notes: When it comes to culinary achievements, the French are venerable hitmakers! Who can turn down a steaming bowl of moules frites? A perfectly flaky, indulgently buttery croissant? A crisp, cascading glass of Champagne? Not I! Wine—they’ve got it! Cognac—yup! But we don’t often think of the French when it comes to bitter liqueurs, and that, my friends, is where we’ve all taken a giant misstep. Enter my bestie, Suze. Yes, bitter, but also floral, savory, piney, and an all-around delight of an apéritif. Now combine that with Lillet Blanc and you’ve got yourself a vanilla- and orange-scented cloud of happiness.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Lillet Blanc
    - ½ ounce Suze apéritif
    - ½ ounce dry vermouth (preferably Mulassano Extra Dry)

    notes: I’m usually pretty willing to let people substitute ingredients if they can’t find what’s called for, but I’m going to be very strict here—if you can’t get your hands on a bottle of brandy made from mirabelle plums, then PLEASE do not make this cocktail. I know it might sound absolutely absurd to have an entire experience hinge on a teaspoon of plum brandy, but that is precisely what I’m saying. My ego thanks you in advance.

    notes: Can you think of anything more delectable, more joyous, or more satisfying than a fresh, perfectly ripe, juicy, fragrant tomato?! Nor can I! To me, tomato season officially means summer. And summer means dips in the lake, a rotation of vegetables on the grill, and the never-ending, relentless search for the perfect dress that is simultaneously flattering and bag-like. When I think Martini, however, I don’t immediately think “Yum, refreshing!” Well, you guessed it—I’m here to change your mind. The key to this cocktail is making sure that it is colder than cold. I recommend that your sherry, vermouth, and Lillet come straight from the fridge when mixing this recipe up, so if you’re using unopened bottles, definitely chill them beforehand.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ripe cherry tomato
    - 1½ ounces Lillet Rosé
    - ¾ ounce fino sherry
    - ¾ ounce dry vermouth
    - 1 teaspoon strawberry liqueur
    - "Garnish: Tomolive"
    steps:
    - At the bottom of your mixing glass, gently muddle the cherry tomato. Add the Lillet Rosé, fino sherry, dry vermouth, and strawberry liqueur. Add ice and stir. Fine-strain into a Nick and Nora glass. Garnish with a tomolive.

    notes: "This is my ode to the Pisco Sour. And yes, I am aware that this cocktail does not have (1) pisco, (2) citrus, or (3) egg white, all defining factors of the Pisco Sour…but I swear, it is indeed inspired by a Pisco Sour. In place of pisco, I’ve enlisted the forces of what shall here on out be known as the Grapey Triumvirate: Floc de Gascogne, Singani, and grappa. I find that both Pisco and FDG have these totally wild floral notes, while Singani is like diving into a bouquet of blossoming pink roses. The grappa, on the other hand, is a bit more rugged and gives the drink a little edge. It’s fascinating to compare three entirely different spirits, from opposite sides of the world, all made from the same raw material, and see how they can complement and extract new flavors from each other. While you will most certainly need to activate your imagination to experience this parallel Pisco Sour universe, it is precisely imagination that we adults could use more of in our daily lives."
    ingredients:
    - 2½ ounces white Floc de Gascogne
    - ½ ounce Singani (preferably Singani 63)
    - 1 teaspoon Clear Creek Pinot Grigio Grappa
    - 1 drop eucalyptus extract
    - "Garnish: Lime twist"
    steps:
    - Combine the Floc de Gascogne, Singani, grappa, and eucalyptus extract in a chilled mixing glass. Add ice and stir. Strain into a Nick and Nora glass. Garnish with an expressed lime twist.

    notes: You’ve had an intense day at work, followed by a crowded commute home. The shoes you’ve been wearing all day have left your toes cramped and your back aching. YOU JUST WANT PIZZA FROM THAT ONE PLACE, but it’s Monday and they are closed Mondays, which you didn’t know, so you fantasized about their pizza all throughout your dreadful day and were counting on said pizza as the reward to get you through it all. You are supremely disappointed but then remember you have a mediocre frozen pizza that you can heat up. You go ahead and do that because sometimes we must settle, but your body is still filled with rage. Because you are a problem solver and an overachiever, you think of the perfect task to calm your nerves. You grab a ziplock bag, fill it with ice, take hold of a hammer, and start banging away. Ta-da, you have crushed ice. You add some booze and after one sip, you remember that most problems are solved by liquids on crushed ice. Your pizza is ready and it’s the most delicious pizza you’ve ever eaten. You didn’t want to deal with that oversized pizza box anyway.
    ingredients:

    - "Garnish: Lavish mint bouquet"
    steps:
    - Rub the mint leaves around the inside of the glass. Discard the mint. Add the pommeau, Irish whiskey, syrup, and cardamom bitters to the glass. Fill halfway with crushed ice and swizzle. Top with more crushed ice and snow-cone it. Garnish with a lavish mint bouquet. Serve with a straw.

    notes: This cocktail reminds me of lace. And I’m not talking about some lace doily your relative has framed in their kitchen. I’m talking couture runway lace. It’s delicate. It’s intricate. It’s glamorous. Made even more gorgeous by a sparkly embellishment here and there. The ingredients combined here are like soft whispers, punctuated by different botanicals, each patiently waiting its turn to reveal itself. But honestly, all poetry aside, this drink is just super fun, full of surprises, and very pretty to look at.

    notes: Listen, as a bartender that makes fancy-schmancy cocktails, I’m not supposed to love a good old Dirty Martini. But I do and have zero shame about it, and neither should you. Honestly, what is better than a Martini and a salt lick all in one devilish liquid package? But I am supposed to make fancy-schmancy drinks (and since I just can’t help myself), I’ve “done it up” a bit. Without the texture of gin or vodka, I opted for Cocchi Americano. While slightly bitter, there is no denying that Cocchi Americano also introduces some fruity notes, so to balance those out and truly adhere to the essence of this savory classic, a quick toasted-caraway infusion keeps this drink in the earthy realm where it deserves to be.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces dry vermouth
    - ¾ ounce Caraway Cocchi Americano Bianco
    - ¼ ounce olive brine (ideally green Castelvetrano)
    - "Garnish: 3 speared olives"
    steps:
    - Combine the vermouth, caraway-infused Cocchi Americano, and olive brine in a chilled mixing glass. Add ice and stir. Strain into a V-Martini glass. Garnish with 3 olives on a pick.

#Decadent Treats
  - name: Blank Space
    notes: Growing up, we didn’t go out to restaurants or cafés much. My mother saved money every way she could, so eating out when we could just “make something even better at home,” as she liked to say, seemed like a frivolity. Of course, everyone, including my mom, needs the occasional meal out, even if it’s just to break the monotony of doing dishes every night, so every now and then my mother and I would venture to the Indian restaurant down the street. It was a special occasion made even more special by the addition of their mango lassi. I knew that my mom considered this part of the order completely superfluous but also acknowledged what a treat it was for me, and thus it went against her rational mind and gave in to just being in the moment.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces amontillado sherry
    - 1½ ounces Mango-Honey Syrup
    - ½ ounce Moscatel sherry
    - ½ ounce organic heavy cream
    - ¼ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - "Garnish: Pistachio nut crumble (finely chopped pistachios) and lemon zest"
    steps:
    - Combine the amontillado sherry, syrup, Moscatel sherry, heavy cream, and lemon juice in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a highball glass over crushed ice. Garnish with pistachio nut crumble and lemon zest. Serve with a straw.

    notes: Many folks misconstrue white créme de cacao and that’s a shame because it is SO GOOD. I think when most people read “crème de cacao” on a cocktail menu, they immediately think the cocktail will be cloyingly sweet. Well people, with all due respect, we aren’t making giant chocolate martinis served in garish glasses with some sort of absurd crumbled candy cane rim here. So please, rid yourself of your preconceived prejudices against this perfectly wonderful liqueur and you’ll open yourself up to a whole other dimension of mouth treats.
    ingredients:
    - ¾ ounce amontillado sherry
    - ¾ ounce white crème de cacao
    - ¾ ounce fennel liqueur
    - ¾ ounce organic heavy cream
    - "Garnish: Fennel pollen, optional"
    steps:
    - Combine the amontillado sherry, white crème de cacao, fennel liqueur, and heavy cream in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a Nick and Nora glass. Garnish with optional fennel pollen dusting.

    notes: Friends, this cocktail is simply about bringing you joy. No-nonsense, unapologetic joy. Because if fresh, frothy pineapple juice combined with spiced pears can’t bring you joy, then I’m not sure anything can. It’s the kind of drink I would enjoy if, say, someone wanted to surprise me with breakfast in bed (hint, hint), or as a way to elongate a perfectly spectacular day for just a few more blissful moments.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Pineau des Charantes
    - ¾ ounce fresh pineapple juice
    - ½ ounce Singani (preferably Singani 63)
    - ½ ounce spiced pear liqueur (preferably St. George)
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Simple Syrup
    - "Garnish: Pineapple wedge"
    steps:
    - Combine the Pineau des Charantes, pineapple juice, Singani, spiced pear liqueur, lemon juice, and syrup in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a coupe and garnish with a pineapple wedge.

    notes: After a busy day of running around, doing this and that, there is nothing quite as satisfying as fixing yourself a proper cocktail. I call this adulting. The second I enter my house, my pants fly off faster than you can say “clove-studded orange crescent,” and I realign and recalibrate with this ultra-luxe highball that feels part sophisticated screen siren and part off-duty club kid.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Clove White Port
    - 1½ ounces Orange Cream Syrup
    - 1 dash Citric Acid Solution
    - Bubbly water, to top
    - "Garnish: Clove-studded orange crescent"
    steps:

    notes: Somehow nothing feels more extravagant than popping a bottle of bubbles open and gleefully pouring them over crushed ice. Perhaps it’s because it feels a little like an act of rebellion. Something that might make a Champagne snob shudder in horror. You’re doing what with that?! But you know better than to just conform, so why not make juleps with bubbly wine and why not combine an ingredient from South America with an ingredient from Japan? This rebel without a cause veers far from the original julep (which dates back to the 1800s), and the result is a cocktail that’s both supremely floral and downright musky.
    ingredients:
    - 5 or 6 mint leaves
    - 3 ounces dry white sparkling wine
    - ½ ounce Singani (preferably Singani 63)
    - ¼ ounce St. Germain elderflower liqueur
    - 1 teaspoon Honey Syrup
    - 2 dashes matcha bitters
    - "Garnish: Lavish mint bouquet and matcha powder"
    steps:
    - Rub the mint leaves around the inside of the cup. Discard the mint. Add the sparkling wine, Singani, St. Germain, syrup, and matcha bitters to the glass. Fill the glass halfway with crushed ice and swizzle. Top with more crushed ice and snow-cone it (see Speaking of Crushed Ice, this page). Garnish with a lavish mint bouquet and a dusting of matcha powder. Serve with a straw.

    notes: In a past life, I was an actress. After college, my life revolved around auditioning. Many days were spent running from one audition to the next, back to back, for hours on end, leaving little time to eat. So, like any clear-thinking thespian, I would sometimes make a quick stop at a bar and drink a Guinness, because if you didn’t know, Guinness basically counts as food, as it’s rich in iron and very filling. After my fortifying liquid meal, I would continue on with my auditions. And now that I read this all back to myself, I can’t help but think that perhaps this is why I never made it as an actress. Well, anyhow, here is my jazzed-up stout beer cocktail that somehow tastes like cake.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces red Macvin du Jura
    - 1 ounce barista-quality oat milk (preferably Oatly)
    - ¼ ounce Demerara Syrup
    - 1 teaspoon St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram Liqueur
    - 1 whole organic egg
    - Stout beer, to top
    - "Garnish: Freshly grated nutmeg"
    steps:
    - Combine the Macvin du Jura, oat milk, syrup, allspice liqueur, and egg in a shaker. Pre-shake without ice, making sure the whole egg is properly incorporated. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a fizz glass. Top with stout. Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.

    notes: As a teenager, I would say, I was pretty good about keeping my cool in public. Sure, I had a crush on a certain member of the Backstreet Boys, but when I purchased, of course totally ironically, a ticket to see the Backstreet Boys at an arena that was three hours away, because I had a great sense of humor, it was just to have a fun night with my girlfriend. You know, because it was funny! Did totally cool and collected teenage Natasha who smoked cigarettes in between class hurl her body over a wall of screaming girls so that she could try to touch one of the Backstreet Boys as they passed by? Oh yes. Yes, she did. So, let me just say, the color of this cocktail is enough to send any human with even a slight detection of hormones into a complete frenzy. But don’t worry, the flavors of this teenage dream are all grown up.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Bruto Americano
    - 1½ ounces fresh pineapple juice

    notes: Building on the floral notes of Amaro Montenegro, this cocktail is balanced by the earthy calm of amontillado sherry and the dry, clean salinity of fino sherry. I love the oddball combination of sherry and amaro for this, but orange juice is the key. With its tart sweetness, orange juice adds a plump and juicy component if balanced properly.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Amaro Montenegro
    - ¾ ounce amontillado sherry
    - ¾ ounce fino sherry
    - ½ ounce Oat-geat
    - ½ ounce dry curaçao
    - ½ ounce fresh orange juice
    - ¼ ounce fresh lime juice
    - "Garnish: Lavish mint bouquet"
    steps:
    - Combine the Amaro Montenegro, amontillado sherry, fino sherry, oat-geat, dry curaçao, orange juice, and lime juice in a shaker. Add 2 ice cubes and give it a short shake. Strain into a festive glass filled with crushed ice. Top with more crushed ice and snow-cone it. Garnish with a lavish mint bouquet. Serve with a straw.

    notes: Oh, this old thing? You know that response you give when you know you look absolutely stunning but don’t want to sound like you are your own hype person. That’s this drink. It requires a little behind-the-scenes prep, but come showtime, this is shockingly easy to throw together on the spot. Having one person over? Perfect, just quickly whip this up. Having ten people over? Also perfect, as this cocktail is built in the glass, and all you need to do is create a little production line and dole them out.
    ingredients:
    - ½ ounce Mulled Wine Reduction
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 5 ounces dry Lambrusco wine
    steps:

    notes: I think this cocktail speaks to Suze’s incredible versatility. It’s an ingredient you rarely see outside the standard-plus-soda or White Negroni. You’ve heard me sing multiple praises to this bottle of wonder before, but this joyful iteration makes you feel like you just belly-laughed after hearing the dirtiest joke of all time. The rich caramelized banana liqueur, the hints of golden raisins from the sauterne, and the way it’s almost dripping overripe tropical fruit from the rum are all in stark contrast to Suze’s bright and bitter kick, making this cocktail a wonderfully naughty contradiction.	
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Suze apéritif
    - ¾ ounce sauterne
    - ¼ ounce banana liqueur (preferably Tempus Fugit)
    - ½ teaspoon overproof Jamaican rum (preferably Smith & Cross)
    steps:

    notes: Fluffy, whipped clouds of rice pudding covered in a blanket of soft marshmallows. If this is your idea of heaven, well then, congratulations, because you have reached nirvana. Now, in order to achieve nirvana, one does of course have to be willing to put in a little rigorous work behind the scenes. To achieve ultimate cushy-level enlightenment, one must follow proper technique. The process—or if we are going to continue this outrageous metaphor of mine, the path—is strangely satisfying, and that first transformative sip, where your lips just sort of sink into a pillow of downy feathers, is entirely fantastical.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces unfiltered sake
    - 1 ounce Vanilla Syrup
    - ¾ ounce coconut milk
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ¼ ounce Giffard Lichi-Li Liqueur
    - 4 drops orange flower water
    - 1 organic egg white
    - Bubbly water, to top
    - "Garnish: Expressed then discarded lemon twist and lime zest"
    steps:
    - Combine the unfiltered sake, syrup, coconut milk, lemon juice, lime juice, Lichi-Li, orange flower water, and egg white in a shaker. Pre-shake with no ice. Add 5 or 6 cubed ice cubes and shake until the ice is practically dissolved and you can feel the contents of the shaker expanding. The contents of your shaker should be frothy and airy. Strain into a chilled highball glass. Tap the glass on a hard surface to get the cocktail to settle and to remove air bubbles. Add a splash of bubbly water. Tap again on a hard surface. Gradually add more bubbly water, building an egg white head and tapping when necessary. Express a lemon twist over the cocktail then discard. Garnish with freshly grated lime zest. Remember, patience is key in this cocktail. Take your time. There’s no rush (even though I know I told you that you are in a race against time just a few chapters ago).

It’s one of those indulgences that I think I’ve only been able to give in to while staying in a hotel. Therefore, doing so while wearing a plush terry robe post hot bath soak and with the television playing in the background is also mandatory.

    notes: This is all about letting yourself be in a festive mood! It’s one of those drinks that pretty much anyone with a beating heart will enjoy. You can dance while holding it. You can hug while holding it. It’s bubbly, a pretty deep red, and it has drippy cherries by way of Maurin Quina. What’s not to like? And best of all, it comes together so easily and is filled to the brim with impactful, warming flavors. Completely suitable for both a snow-covered holiday soirée or summer solstice under a blanket of stars.

This drink is an ode to that way-too-sweet sucker from the past, but hopefully it boasts more characteristics than just sugar.

    notes: There’s a certain elegance and mystery to this cocktail that I can’t quite put my finger on (and I will also say that calling my own cocktail elegant and mysterious feels entirely pompous and uncomfortable). But this one is a sort of strange puzzle, and with each sip you discover something new. I love drinks like that. Ones that feel like they are moving with you. That’s the brilliance of a complex liqueur such as Strega and the almost animated expression of a well-made fruit brandy working in harmony with some solid, definitive base spirits. I also kind of adore how “easy” this reads on paper but what a complete and utter journey this drink is in real life.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Lillet Blanc

    notes: Honestly, there’s not much to say here because all you really need to know is that this cocktail has ice cream. However, since I have your attention, I might as well talk a little about this vermouth-based limoncello and why I’m obsessed with it. If you’ve ever had the pleasure of sipping on straight-out-of-the-freezer limoncello in a teeny-tiny cordial glass, you’ll understand the undeniable joy that comes with this experience. The lemon-bomb liqueur itself is bright yellow, perfectly sweet and viscous, but with a pronounced bitterness. I hope this cocktail-sundae can be shared with people that you simply adore, especially those who appreciate a heavy-handed rainbow sprinkle.
    ingredients:
    - 1 overly generous scoop of vanilla ice cream
    - 1½ ounces Vermouth Limoncello, chilled
    - 1 ounce Salers Gentiane Apéritif, chilled
    - ¼ ounce chamomile grappa liqueur, chilled
    - "Garnish: Lemon zest, rainbow sprinkles, brandied cherry"
    steps:
    - Scoop one heaping scoop of vanilla ice cream into your glass of choice. Add the vermouth limoncello, Salers, and chamomile grappa. Garnish with lemon zest, rainbow sprinkles, and a brandied cherry and all of its dripping deliciousness. Serve with a spoon.

    notes: Although popular in France, the Mauresque, a cocktail made by assembling pastis, orgeat, and water over ice, gets little airtime here in the States. It’s a strangely delicious concoction and one that I wish I thought of drinking more often. In this little play on that classic, I’ve replaced the water with freshly pressed Granny Smith apple juice and poured the mix over my fun-loving standby, crushed ice. It’s a simple twist that makes a big impact.

When you finally get to taste it, it’s an intense sugar rush that is immediately met with a swift wave of tart, tingly fruit. Well, this cocktail is inspired by my fantasy sorbet flavor, and by that I mean it literally doesn’t exist, but I wish it did. In the fantasy sorbet isle, this flavor is equally fruity and bitter and tastes like you’re walking under a blossoming cherry tree.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces red Macvin du Jura
    - ¾ ounce fresh grapefruit juice
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Aperol

    notes: This devilish cocktail should envelop you like a fleece-lined cashmere blanket. Each sip should relax your shoulders that much more, warming your soul and making that catastrophic run-in with your ex earlier in the day feel like a distant, blurry memory. Also, you were wearing those jeans that make your butt look great, so why are we even calling it catastrophic? Back to the drink, which is served warm and whose spoonful of melted coconut oil goes fantastically well with the notes of golden raisins from the PDC and cinnamon from the aged rum. But don’t worry, this drink isn’t heavy or overly rich. It’s that perfect amount of decadence to help ease the worry of the day. Or the perfect reward after catching another glimpse of your butt in those jeans.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Pineau des Charantes
    - ¾ ounce Cardamaro
    - ¾ ounce sweet (red) vermouth
    - ¾ ounce filtered water

    - ½ teaspoon organic virgin coconut oil
    - 1 pinch kosher salt
    steps:
    - Combine the Pineau des Charantes, Cardamaro, sweet vermouth, water, rum, and salt in a small pot. Heat over medium heat until it’s just about to start simmering (do not let boil). Stir in the coconut oil. Pour into a Nick and Nora glass. Serve immediately. And it goes without saying, this drink is hot, so hold your glass by the stem.

#Party Starters
  - name: Journey to the Milky Way
    notes: Imagine if a flawless glass of white wine ate a hallucinogenic mushroom. As the magical mind trip sets sail, it rides illuminated waves under a glistening moon. “I want to be the most luscious version of myself I can be!” the glass of wine exclaims. The moon smiles with an iridescent, knowing glow. “Fill me with your magic,” whispers the glass of wine, mouth agape. A torrential storm of stars starts falling from the sky. Neon rainbows appear and push their way in front of heavy clouds. Happy cows are leaping. Pineapples shine golden in the sun. The glass of wine takes a deep, meditative breath. It is perfect. Did I go too far? Slash yes, this is a white wine milk punch, and it is really yummy and I’m so excited for you to try it, thanks so much. Serves 5 or 6.
    ingredients:
    - 8 ounces organic grass-fed (if possible) whole milk
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle full-bodied white wine, such as a chardonnay
    - 6 ounces sauterne
    - 3 ounces Velvet Falernum liqueur
    - 1½ ounces Pineapple Gum Syrup
    steps:
    - In a small pot over medium heat, heat the milk until it’s just about to simmer. Do not let the milk boil. In a large bowl, combine the white wine, sauterne, Velvet Falernum, and syrup. Add the warmed milk. The milk will immediately begin to curdle as it reacts to the acid in the wine. Let sit for 2 minutes. Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth into another bowl. Discard the solids. Repeat this until all solids are removed, three or four times. Please note that the final result will be cloudy in color (the fat from the milk wash will add texture and dimension). Store in a sealed container and refrigerate until it is cold. When ready to serve, some residue may have settled at the bottom of your container. Gently shake to reincorporate. Serve by pouring 5 ounces over cubed ice in a wineglass or intergalactic chalice.

    notes: Cucumber juice can quite literally create magic! If the word freshness had a taste, it would be just-juiced cucumber. It has the ability to awaken all senses, make you feel completely alert, and transform your mental mindset. Combine that with the bright green herbs in dry vermouth and you’ve already got yourself a winning duo—that admittedly is a bit predictable. As a little surprise, I’ve added the almost hay-like flavor of saffron, a true earthy delight. It’s just the slightest little crinkle that takes you somewhere unexpected. Serves 4 to 6.
    ingredients:
    - 8 ounces dry vermouth
    - 4 ounces fresh cucumber juice
    - 3 ounces fresh lime juice
    - 2 ounces Simple Syrup
    - 1 ounce Apologue saffron liqueur
    - 16 ounces dry white sparkling wine
    - "Garnish: 5 cucumber slices (seedless) and 5 lime wheels, plus more for garnishing each glass"
    steps:
    - In a large shaker, or working in batches with a small shaker, combine the dry vermouth, cucumber juice, lime juice, syrup, and saffron liqueur. Add ice and shake. Strain into a pitcher with cubed ice. Top with sparkling wine. Stir to incorporate all the ingredients. Garnish with cucumber slices and lime wheels. Serve in wine glasses over cubed ice.

  - name: The Happiest Mulled Wine in All the Land
    notes: I’m going to say it. If you don’t like a mug filled with warming mulled wine, I think you are a person who refuses to let joy into your life. And I say that being a person who throughout this entire book hasn’t criticized anyone’s personal likes or dislikes, because that is precisely what they are—personal. But when it comes to hot, spiced wine-soup, I have to put my foot down. I’m convinced that the reason you didn’t like it is because you had one that was just downright bad, but please give this recipe a whirl, because what is more welcoming than a home that’s fragrantly brimming with star anise–laced warmth? Serves 6 to 8.
    ingredients:
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle dry red wine
    - 8 ounces Becherovka
    - 1 ounce orange liqueur	
    - ½ cup demerara sugar
    - 10 whole cloves
    - 3 whole star anise
    - 2 cinnamon sticks
    - 1 medium lemon, thinly sliced and deseeded
    - 1 medium orange, thinly sliced and deseeded
    - "Garnish: 5 clove-studded orange crescents, plus more for garnishing each glass"
    steps:
    - In a large pot, combine the red wine, Becherovka, orange liqueur, sugar, cloves, star anise, and cinnamon sticks. Stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Add the sliced lemon and sliced orange, cover, and let simmer on low heat for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Strain out the solids. When ready to serve, reheat over medium heat, making sure never to bring to a boil. Serve in a mug and garnish with a clove-studded orange crescent.

    notes: This is a truly sessionable cooler. I can’t think of anything better to sip on during the day with friends. It’s light, refreshing, vegetal, juicy, and most importantly just super delicious. It also speaks volumes to the beauty of no frills—it’s simply fresh ingredients mixed in the right proportions. To make this drink even more perfect, there is no shaking or fine straining or double shaking. Life does not get any easier than this (she says after instructing you to juice three different kinds of fruit). Serves 4 to 6.
    ingredients:
    - 8 ounces white vermouth (preferably Cinzano bianco)
    - 4 ounces fresh Granny Smith apple juice
    - 3 ounces fresh celery juice
    - 3 ounces fresh lime juice
    - 3 ounces Simple Syrup

    steps:

  - name: If These Walls Could Talk
    notes: In the fantasy world I’ve created for this punch, Bianca Jagger, Cher, and Diana Ross are just casually throwing things into a hollowed-out disco ball. “Diana, do you have an apron I can borrow?” asks Cher. “I don’t want to get any sugar on this Bob Mackie sweatshirt.”			“Darling, I’m just going to throw a couple of these cinnamon sticks into your simple syrup!” exclaims Bianca in another one of her nonchalant moments of brilliance. “Let me pop these bubbles,” says Diana, grabbing an unsuspecting bottle from her icebox. “What a delight. This is a bottle of red bubbles!”	“Fabulous,” cheers Bianca and Cher in unison. And, well, there you have it. Serves 6 to 8.
    ingredients:
    - 8 ounces amontillado sherry
    - 3 ounces fresh lemon juice
    - 3 ounces Cinnamon Syrup
    - ½ ounce peach liqueur
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle dry Lambrusco wine
    - "Garnish: 5 lemon wheels and 5 fresh thyme sprigs, plus more for garnishing each glass"
    steps:
    - In a large shaker, or working in batches with a small shaker, combine the amontillado sherry, lemon juice, syrup, and peach liqueur. Add ice and shake. Strain into a punch bowl (or hollowed-out disco ball) with mega ice. Top with Lambrusco and give it a stir. Garnish with lemons wheels and fresh thyme (that Diana had growing by her pool).

So grab a handful of friends who like to wear silk headscarves and perfectly knit soft cardigans, hop on your vintage bicycles, and pedal on down that cobblestone side street, because there’s a pitcher of fruity delights awaiting you in a field of wildflowers. Serves 8 to 10.
    ingredients:
    - 4 ounces Bonal Gentiane-Quina
    - 4 ounces pommeau
    - 3 ounces fresh lemon juice

    notes: An Aperol Spritz but make it dirty. And I mean that in the best way possible. If you’re looking for something a little more rugged, with a bit more grit, this is like the Aperol Spritz ditched the piazza for the mountains and is taking a hike after a rainstorm. Boots are muddied, wild strawberries are foraged, and the sparkling wine is chilled in a…um…waterfall! Serves 6 to 8.
    ingredients:
    - 10 ounces Beet Aperol
    - 2 ounces strawberry liqueur
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle dry white sparkling wine
    - 10 ounces bubbly water
    - "Garnish: 5 grapefruit crescents, plus more to garnish each glass"

    notes: For those days when I am dreaming about a kitchen garden in my future, because who doesn’t need a perfect little garden conveniently located right off the side of their kitchen door dedicated to growing the ingredients of a perfect tomato sauce? It all seems very grown-up and lovely and aspirational, and it would be the sort of garden where I would grow fennel and wild elderflower and then just whip something together when unexpected company showed up at my door while my hair is perfectly messy, and I suddenly turn into Nigella Lawson. Serves 4 to 6.
    ingredients:
    - 6 ounces Salers Gentiane Apéritif
    - 3 ounces fresh grapefruit juice
    - 3 ounces fresh lime juice
    - 3 ounces Fennel Syrup

    notes: There’s a certain group of so-called experts in drinking culture who like to shame people for liking delicious things because they’ve deemed them “basic” (whatever that means). I have a feeling that this seemingly “simple” punch would fall into that category, but don’t be bullied into their quite frankly boring, one-dimensional way of thinking. I call on you to embrace this not at all frou-frou, pink as all hell, strawberry-mint dream of a punch, edible flower garnish and all. Serves 8 to 10.
    ingredients:
    - 3 whole strawberries, leaves removed
    - 10 ounces Lillet Rosé
    - 4 ounces lemon juice
    - 2 ounces Simple Syrup
    - 1 ounce Giffard Menthe-Pastille Liqueur
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle dry sparkling rosé wine
    - "Garnish: 10 strawberry slices, 5 lemon wheels, and 3 edible flowers, plus more for garnishing each glass"
    steps:
    - In a large shaker, or working in batches with a small shaker, lightly muddle the strawberries. Add the Lillet Rosé, lemon juice, syrup, and menthe-pastille liqueur. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into your pitcher filled halfway with cubed ice. Top with sparkling rosé. Stir to incorporate ingredients and add more ice. Garnish with strawberry slices, lemon wheels, and edible flowers.

    notes: This is that drink everyone is sipping on at the very end of the party. The music is loud. The makeup is runny. Shoes are off not because people are too wobbly on their feet; they are off so that the dancing can continue. Buttons are undone because shirts can be constricting, and you’ve still got hours of revelry in you. This cocktail is all about awakening your senses and letting that yuzu juice tingle and tickle your tongue. Also, if I haven’t already talked about my love of Suze + passion fruit, let me tell you that it’s a combination I love with such intensity that I physically have to restrain myself from putting them into every single cocktail. Serves 4 to 6.
    ingredients:
    - 8 ounces dry white wine
    - 4 ounces Suze apéritif
    - 2 ounces Giffard Fruit de la Passion Liqueur
    - 2 ounces fresh Meyer lemon juice

    - 10 ounces bubbly water
    - "Garnish: 7 edible flowers, plus more for garnishing each glass"

    notes: Blood oranges are technically in season for like twenty-four hours a year, and I look forward to it every time. There is, strangely, something quite vampire-esque about the taste, a sort of metallic, very mineral-forward, sweet juiciness. When combined with either lemon or lime juice, it takes on all sorts of bright, cheerful characteristics as well, while still maintaining some of its mystery. It’s this flavor combination that drew me to pair it with East India sherry, a sherry that feels luxurious as it’s so full of seductive deep raisin notes. Serves 6 to 8.
    ingredients:
    - 8 ounces East India sherry
    - 4 ounces white rum (preferably Owney’s)
    - 4 ounces fresh pineapple juice	
    - 3 ounces fresh lime juice
    - 3 ounces fresh blood orange juice
    - 2 ounces Simple Syrup
    - 16 ounces dry Lambrusco wine
    - "Garnish: 5 lime wheels, 5 blood orange crescents, and freshly grated cinnamon, plus more for garnishing each glass"
    steps:
    - In a large shaker, or working in batches with a small shaker, combine the East India sherry, rum, pineapple juice, lime juice, blood orange juice, and syrup. Add ice and shake. Strain into a punch bowl with mega/large-format ice. Top with Lambrusco. Stir to incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with lime wheels, blood orange crescents, and freshly grated cinnamon.

    notes: The idea behind this one is that it’s almost too easy to make, so it’s perfectly acceptable for one of the ingredients to be an infusion. Each ingredient on its own, while supremely delicious, is what I like to describe as soft. But when brought together, they are transformed into a vibrant tour de force. I simply adore this cocktail and created it with a wide range of palates in mind. It’s kind of like a peace offering between the Martini drinker and the Sour drinker, brought together by the harmony of a big bowl of booze. Serves 10 to 14.
    ingredients:
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle dry sparkling wine, chilled
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle Thai Basil Blanc Vermouth, chilled
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle manzanilla sherry, chilled
    - 750 ml fresh watermelon juice
    - "Garnish: 15 lemon wheels"
    steps:
    - In an extra-large punch bowl over a mega ice block, combine the sparkling wine, basil-infused vermouth, manzanilla sherry, and watermelon juice. Stir to incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with lemon wheels.

    notes: I remember being introduced to the art of the Michelada pretty late into my bartending journey, when I started working behind the bar at Mayahuel. While Mayahuel certainly didn’t invent the Michelada (a traditional Mexican beverage dating back almost one hundred years), the bartenders there were well versed in coming up with some pretty epic variations. In this version, I’ve replaced the tomato element with a smoky ancho chile by way of Ancho Reyes, which adds a beautiful earthy layer to this otherwise refreshing, sharp cocktail. It’s the perfect partner to an extravagant snack setup. Serves 6 to 8.
    ingredients:
    - 2 (12-ounce) bottles Mexican lager beer, such as Modelo Especial
    - 4 ounces fresh pineapple juice	
    - 3 ounces Ancho Reyes Ancho Chile Liqueur
    - 2 ounces fresh lime juice
    - 2 ounces agave nectar
    - "Garnish: 7 lime wheels, plus more to garnish each glass"
    steps:
    - In a pitcher filled halfway with cubed ice, add the beer. Let settle. In a large shaker, or working in batches with a small shaker, combine the pineapple juice, Ancho Reyes, lime juice, and agave nectar. Add ice and shake. Strain into the pitcher with the beer. Fill with more ice and stir to incorporate ingredients. Garnish with lime wheels. If desired, rim double rocks glasses with salt before serving.

    - "Garnish: Cocktail onion, in glass only"

# The Celebration Never Stops
  - name: Mental Note
    notes: The awe-inspiring color of this drink is vibrant enough to wake you from the depths of a deep, satisfying slumber. The first sip is intended to give you a little spark of electricity that you can feel all the way down in your toes. Tart but unwaveringly earthy, it’s equally comforting and life-giving. And then of course there is our bestie, crushed ice, which makes this combination taste that much better. Go ahead and choose joy today.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces fresh grapefruit juice
    - 1 ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce fresh beet juice
    - ½ ounce Vanilla Syrup
    - 1 heaping barspoon of raspberry preserves (the kind with seeds!)
    - "Garnish: Grapefruit crescent and lemon wheel"
    steps:
    - Combine the grapefruit juice, lemon juice, beet juice, syrup, and raspberry preserves in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a festive glass over crushed ice. Top with more crushed ice and snow-cone it. Garnish with a grapefruit crescent and lemon wheel. Serve with a straw.

    notes: When you plan a surprise party for someone, there are only two ways it can go. Either they will love it, be overcome with happy warm feelings, and passionately kiss you as they fight back tears, or they will give you a look so sharp it cuts your soul, and you feel instant regret for having devoted days of your life to bring this moment to fruition. Well, just ignore the possibility of the second outcome, and sink deep into scenario number one. That’s this drink. It’s your favorite person’s birthday and it’s going to be totally great. This drink starts out totally lovely, perhaps even comfortingly predictable, and then you get a hit of the yuzu koshu and your day has suddenly turned into a past-midnight fête.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces fresh orange juice
    - 1½ ounces Vanilla Syrup
    - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ¾ ounce organic heavy cream
    - 1 teaspoon green yuzu kosho
    - 1 organic egg white
    - Bubbly water, to top
    - "Garnish: Expressed then discarded orange twist"
    steps:
    - Combine the orange juice, syrup, lime juice, heavy cream, yuzu kosho, and egg white in a shaker. Pre-shake with no ice. Add ice and shake for at least 1 minute. Strain into a highball glass and top with bubbly water. Express an orange twist over the cocktail then discard.

    notes: The world’s most delightful glass of grown-up milk. And even though you are an adult, I do feel the need to warn you that the garnish is indeed on fire, so please avoid planting your face on it.
    ingredients:
    - 4 ounces barista-quality oat milk (preferably Oatly)
    - ½ ounce Cinnamon Syrup
    - ½ teaspoon matcha powder
    - 2 drops rose flower water
    - "Garnish: Flaming cinnamon stick"
    steps:
    - Combine the oat milk, syrup, and matcha powder in a shaker. Add 2 ice cubes and shake. Strain into a double rocks glass over crushed ice. Top with more crushed ice and snow-cone it (see Speaking of Crushed Ice, this page). Tuck a cinnamon stick into the crushed ice and light it on fire. Blow out the flame and let the cinnamon stick smoke. Serve with a straw. And please, don’t put the straw right next to the smoking HOT cinnamon stick.

    notes: Do you ever take that first big satisfying sip of a Margarita and think to yourself, “This tastes life-giving and cleansing!” If you answered with a resounding YES, then this is the cure to your craving. This is every juicy, spicy, savory dream wrapped up in a festive salt-speckled bow. I often find drinking celery juice on its own a little, shall we say, lacking, so the gooey yum of the agave nectar is there to give this drink some texture and weight.
    ingredients:
    - 2 jalapeño slices
    - 1 cilantro sprig
    - ¾ ounce agave nectar
    - 3 ounces fresh celery juice
    - 1 ounce fresh lime juice
    - 3 drops Salt Solution
    - "Garnish: Tajín salt rim and celery spear"
    steps:
    - At the bottom of a shaker, muddle the jalapeño, cilantro, and agave nectar. Add the celery juice, lime juice, and salt solution. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a Tajín-rimmed double rocks glass over large-format ice. Garnish with a celery spear.

    notes: Watermelon juice is basically the universe’s gift to humans who are parched but bored by water. When watermelon is ultra-ripe, all you have to do is look at it and it basically juices itself. I love a touch of savory with pretty much anything sweet, and a little touch of a neutral yet flavorful vinegar can make such a dramatic impact. Throw a few fresh, equally-in-season basil leaves into the mix and you can basically just sit back and let Mother Nature do her thing. And if you’re not already wearing a straw hat, I highly recommend putting one on.
    ingredients:
    - 5 ounces fresh watermelon juice
    - 1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar
    - 5 or 6 basil leaves
    - "Garnish: Smoked-salt rim, lime wheel, and basil bouquet"
    steps:
    - Gently muddle the basil leaves at the bottom of your glass. In a shaker, combine the watermelon juice, rice vinegar, and basil leaves. Add ice and shake. Strain into a smoked salt–rimmed highball glass over cubed ice. Garnish with a lime wheel and fresh basil bouquet. Serve with a straw.

    notes: When I was a teenager, spiced chai became all the rage among my group of friends. We would buy that almost unbearably sweet chai concentrate in a paper carton, mix it with milk, talk about our feelings, and absolutely not ever smoke a cigarette with it. This drink calls for chilled, brewed chai, and it’s a choose-your-own-adventure-type call. If you want to keep it light, simply brew your tea in hot water, or, for something more decadent, make a milk tea by steeping your tea in the warmed milk of your choice, though I recommend full-fat cow’s milk or macadamia milk, which pairs lovely with the pineapple.
    ingredients:
    - 3 ounces chilled brewed spiced chai
    - 1 ounce coconut milk
    - ¾ ounce Pineapple Gum Syrup
    - 1 fresh lime leaf
    - "Garnish: Coconut flakes and fresh lime zest"
    steps:
    - Combine the chai, coconut milk, syrup, and lime leaf in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a festive footed tulip glass over crushed ice. Garnish with coconut flakes and lime zest. Serve with a straw.

    notes: Once I passed the thirty-years-old mark, I, like many adults before me, invested in my first pair of well-made jeans. Oh, the difference! I wasn’t tugging them back up every two seconds, their material felt sturdy, my bum never looked better. And that brings me to lemonade. Who doesn’t love lemonade? But just as with jeans, there’s lemonade and there’s LEMONADE. I love mine with a higher-than-usual lemon-to-sugar ratio, because I want my face to scrunch up as if I were taking a generous bite from a lemon wedge. This recipe is the upgrade you’ve been looking for, even if you are under thirty.
    ingredients:
    - 1 whole green cardamom pod
    - 2 ounces fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Honey Syrup
    - San Bitter or other nonalcoholic red bitter soda, to top
    - "Garnish: Lemon wheel"
    steps:
    - At the bottom of a shaker, lightly muddle the cardamom pod until it has broken apart. Add the lemon juice and syrup. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a double rocks glass filled with cubed ice and top with the red bitter soda. Garnish with a lemon wheel.

    notes: My cure for the Something & Tonic craving that packs a flavorful punch. It’s ideal for sipping while feeling at peace, dancing under a flickering strobe light. But also equally as enjoyable sunbathing, bum out, on your rooftop. An invigorating experience you’ll feel in your whole body.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Salted Lemon-Lime Cordial
    - ½ ounce Cinnamon Syrup
    - 1 fresh curry leaf
    - Tonic water, to top
    - "Garnish: Lime wheel and lemon wheel"
    steps:
    - Combine the lemon-lime cordial, syrup, and curry leaf in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a highball glass with cubed ice. Top with tonic water. Garnish with lime wheel and lemon wheel. Serve with a straw.

    notes: This drink is inspired by my love of grilled red bell peppers. Large get-togethers at our house in the summer almost always mean a large platter of grilled vegetables. My favorite is always the pepper, smothered in good olive oil and plenty of salt. I had experimented with grilling the peppers for this drink before juicing, but of course that meant sacrificing their brilliant sweetness and crispness, which would have been a real bummer to lose. Enter hickory liquid smoke. I was able to keep everything tasting fresh while adding a powerful baseline of gritty smokiness.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces fresh red bell pepper juice
    - 1 ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce Pomegranate Grenadine
    - ½ ounce Simple Syrup
    - 10 drops hickory liquid smoke
    - "Garnish: Lemon wheel"
    steps:
    - Combine the bell pepper juice, lemon juice, pomegranate grenadine, syrup, and liquid smoke in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain into a double rocks glass over large-format ice. Garnish with a lemon wheel.

    notes: Pure liquid fortification. Combining two of my favorites here, freshly pressed carrot and pineapple juices, with the clean spicy notes of the ginger makes this an ideal companion to raucous conversation or a lively, straight-out-of-bed solo morning. Your body should feel good about drinking this, look forward to it, maybe even crave it so much that you make it part of your weekly rotation of self-care rituals.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces fresh carrot juice
    - ¾ ounce fresh pineapple juice
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Cinnamon Syrup
    - 1 organic egg white
    - Ginger beer, to top
    - "Garnish: Expressed then discarded lemon twist and pineapple wedge"
    steps:
    - Combine the carrot juice, pineapple juice, lemon juice, syrup, and egg white in a shaker. Pre-shake with no ice. Add ice and shake. Fine-strain into a fizz glass. Top with ginger beer. Express a lemon twist over the cocktail then discard. Garnish with a pineapple wedge.

    notes: I think I could sip on this all day, every day. There’s something strikingly elegant about this drink. But at the same time, it certainly doesn’t take itself too seriously. Inspired by my love of Shirley Temples as a child, which I only got to drink once a year when we visited my grandmother and had dinner at the Golden Dragon, where we feasted on paper-wrapped chicken and thick sauce-drenched rice noodles.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Raspberry Syrup
    - ¾ ounce white verjus
    - Bubbly water, to top
    - "Garnish: 3 lemon wheels"
    steps:
    - In a wine glass filled with cubed ice, build the syrup, verjus, and bubbly water. Stir to chill and incorporate all ingredients. Garnish with 3 lemon wheels.

    notes: There’s not much I need to say about this drink except that it’s as refreshing as walking into the walk-in cooler during a hot summer shift. Juicy and tart with a little kick from the fresh ginger, it’s easy to lose track of how many you’ve drunk, thus I’ve made this sans alcohol.			
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces fresh pineapple juice
    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ¼ ounce Ginger Syrup
    - Nonalcoholic lager, to top
    - "Garnish: Lime wedge"
    steps:
    - Combine the pineapple juice, lime juice, and syrup in a shaker. Add 2 ice cubes and shake. Strain into a festive glass with cubed ice. Top with nonalcoholic lager. Garnish with a lime wedge.

    notes: You know what I love? Salad dressing. I’m not talking creamy ranch or Caesar (though my obsession with finding the perfect Caesar salad is pretty infamous among my circle of friends). I’m talking vinaigrette. I like my dressing to be so vinegary that it gives me a shiver. I often combine different vinegars on one salad, then different mustards and honeys, too. The best bite of salad is when the salad is gone, and you get to grab a spoon and just drink the veggie-soaked puddle of dressing remaining in the bottom of the bowl. This drink is my socially acceptable salad-dressing juice cocktail.
    ingredients:
    - 3 ounces fresh carrot juice
    - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ½ ounce Salted Cane Syrup
    - ½ ounce pickle brine
    - 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
    - "Garnish: Pickled carrot and lime wedge"
    steps:
    - Combine the carrot juice, lime juice, syrup, pickle brine, and horseradish in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Strain* into a highball glass over fresh ice. Garnish with a pickled carrot and a lime wedge. Serve with a straw.
    - "*Pssst. So, you know how I told you to make sure the gate on your hawthorn strainer is always tightly closed. Well, here’s the exception to that rule. In fact, make sure that the gate is not closed to ensure that all of the horseradish makes it into the glass."
