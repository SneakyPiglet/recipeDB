    notes: Alex has long been captivated by the combination of scotch and raisins, an obsession born from late-night snacks accompanied by big glasses of whiskey. Indeed, the concentrated fruitiness of raisins pairs perfectly with the lusciousness of a blended scotch like Famous Grouse. In addition to flavor, the madeira and Bénédictine bring a balanced amount of sweetness to the cocktail, making any extra sweetener unnecessary.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Raisin-Infused Scotch (page 292)
    - ½ ounce Barbeito 5-year rainwater madeira
    - ¼ ounce Busnel Pays d'Auge VSOP Calvados
    - ¼ ounce Bénédictine
    - 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters
    - "Garnish: 1 lemon twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into an Old-Fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube

    notes: In the early days of cocktails, vermouth was becoming popular in America and found its way into the Old-Fashioned template, resulting in this nuanced, low-ABV sipper. This classic recipe also demonstrates that not all Old-Fashioned-style drinks are served over ice in rocks glasses.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth
    - ½ teaspoon simple syrup
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters 1 dash orange bitters
    - "Garnish: 1 lemon twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a chilled coupe
    - Express the lemon twist over the drink, then set it on the edge of the glass

    notes: Amaro shows off its versatility when used as the core of an Old-Fashioned; it also provides seasoning and sweetness, so neither bitters nor sugar syrup is needed. In this recipe, the brandy primarily provides a focused boozy flavor and dries the drink out, and a generous amount of salt solution rounds off the bitter edges.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Amaro Nonino
    - ¾ ounce Germain-Robin Craft-Method brandy
    - ¼ ounce Amaro Meletti
    - 6 drops Salt Solution 
    - "Garnish: 1 Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into an Old-Fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube

    notes: It's said that in Martinique, where the drink originated, Ti' Punches are served up and consumed in one gulp. Our version is served over ice and meant to be sipped. If you were to change the proportions of the ingredients and shake the drink, you'd have yourself a Daiquiri, but the Ti' Punch is an Old Fashioned, through and through, with the lime peel standing in for the bitters to season the drink. Make sure you include a bit of the lime flesh, as it will brighten the drink nicely.
    ingredients:
    - 1½-inch-thick disk of lime peel with some flesh attached
    - 1 teaspoon Cane Sugar Syrup
    - 2 ounces La Favorite Couer de Canne rhum agricole blanc
    steps: 
    - In an Old-Fashioned glass, muddle the lime and syrup
    - Add the rum, fill the glass with cracked ice, and stir briefly

    notes: This vintage cocktail is an early example of bartenders swapping out sugar for a sweet, flavorful liqueur. Maraschino liqueur isn't as sweet as simple syrup (not to mention that it also has proof), so we up the quantity to ½ ounce.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Rittenhouse rye 
    - ½ ounce Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur 
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    - 1 dash House Orange Bitters

    notes: A low-proof Old-Fashioned that doesn't contain a base spirit, sugar based sweetener, or traditional bitters-and that gets served up in a coupe? Say it ain't so. Though the Chrysanthemum looks like it hails from the Manhattan or Martini family, the proportion of ingredients give away its lineage, with small amounts of Bénédictine and absinthe dutifully sweetening and seasoning the herbaceous vermouth core.
    ingredients:
    - 2½ ounces Dolin dry vermouth 
    - ½ ounce Bénédictine 
    - 1 teaspoon Pernod absinthe

    notes: Reimagining the core and balance of the Old-Fashioned can yield some interesting effects. The Stinger, a pre Prohibition drink of untraceable origin, classically consisted of just brandy and crème de menthe, the latter providing both seasoning and sweetening. For our version of this classic, we include a bit of simple syrup to boost the flavor of the crème de menthe and curtail the brandy's strength. Though it's traditionally served up, we like to dress up our Stinger like a Julep and serve it with two straws for two-person consumption, à la Lady and the Tramp.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac 
    - ½ ounce white crème de menthe 
    - 1 teaspoon simple syrup 
    - "Garnish: 1 mint sprig"
    steps:
    - Shake all the ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into an Old-Fashioned glass filled with crushed ice
    - Garnish with the mint sprig and serve with a straw

    notes: In this Old-Fashioned, one of our most popular cocktails at the Normandie Club, we've manipulated both the core and the balance, using an infused bourbon and a spiced syrup. This cocktail showed us that coconut can shine in spirituous concoctions beyond the usual tiki drinks if it's incorporated into an infusion; just as with nuts, it adds rich body and toasty flavors.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Coconut-Infused Bourbon (page 289)
    - 1 teaspoon Clear Creek 8-year apple brandy
    - 1 teaspoon Spiced Almond Demerara Gum Syrup (page 56) 
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters 
    - "Garnish: 1 dried apple slice on a skewer"

    notes: In the Fancy-Free, the addition of just one dash of orange bitters draws out flavors in the spirits, but the Angostura bitters still serve as the main seasoning agent. By contrast, the Improved Whiskey Cocktail, which was probably one. of the first popular Old-Fashioned variations, turns to absinthe for seasoning, which adds a deep complexity to the cocktail. The sweet red licorice and anise flavors from the Peychaud's bitters dial up the seasoning even more, while also increasing the impression of sweetness.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
    - 1 teaspoon Maraska maraschino liqueur
    - 1 dash absinthe
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters 
    - 1 dash Peychaud's bitters

    notes: Substituting a sweet liqueur or amaro for the sugar in an Old-Fashioned style cocktail is an amazing way to balance a drink while incorporating a unique seasoning. This approach led to the iconic Elder Fashion in our first book and has been a source of inspiration ever since. In the Pop Quiz, Devon includes an orange-flavored amaro, Ramazzotti, and swaps in spicy, chocolatey bitters.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
    - ½ ounce Ramazzotti 
    - 1 teaspoon simple syrup
    - 2 dashes Bittermens Xocolatl Mole Bitters
    - "Garnish: 1 Orange twist"

    notes: This riff on the Pop Quiz (see left) is an example of a Mr. Potato Head variation-making a new drink by swapping out one or more elements. Here, Alex wanted to make a drink that tasted like boozy chocolate without coming across as dessert in a glass. The seasoning comes from not only the bitters but also the amaro.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
    - ½ ounce Cacao Nib-Infused Ramazzotti
    - ½ teaspoon Demerara Gum Syrup
    - 3 dashes Miracle Mile toasted pecan bitters

    notes: The split-base strategy that makes the Ned Ryerson successful can be used to generate a wide variety of drinks. We particularly love pulling back on the base and adding another spirit, like apple brandy, to accent the primary spirit. Together, rye and apple brandy are a magical, crowd-pleasing combination, and St-Germain makes everything it touches taste better. A dash of celery bitters adds just enough savoriness to pull the drink back from excessive sweetness.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Rittenhouse rye 
    - ½ ounce Clear Creek 2-year apple brandy
    - ½ ounce Cardamom-Infused St-Germain
    - ½ teaspoon Demerara Gum Syrup
    - 4 drops Miracle Mile celery bitters

    notes: "When coming up with new cocktail recipes, we often riff on an existing variation from our repertoire. This drink is based on the Golden Boy (page 10), and while it doesn't share any ingredients with that cocktail, it does take inspiration from its flavors: From the same starting point of raisins and whiskey, Devon took this cocktail to a smokier place by adding a touch of peaty Islay scotch to the core and balancing it out with raisin-infused honey syrup."
    ingredients:
    - 1¾ ounces Famous Grouse scotch 
    - ¼ ounce Laphroaig 10-year scotch
    - 1 teaspoon Raisin Honey Syrup

    notes: In the Ned Ryerson, the core includes a small portion of young apple brandy, which adds a juicy flavor to the cocktail, and the Miracle Mile Castilian bitters in the seasoning are full of orange, licorice, and sarsaparilla notes. The result is an Old-Fashioned that's been reimagined with just modest changes.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Bulleit Rye Whiskey
    - ½ ounce Clear Creek 2-year apple brandy

    notes: This is as rich and decadent as an Old-Fashioned gets, but there's not a drop of sugar syrup in it. Instead, the drink derives its sweetness from both a raisiny sherry and a vanilla liqueur, which provide a counterpunch to the nutty split base of Cognac and rum infused with sesame seeds. A dash of bitters is all that's required to zip these big flavors together.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Pierre Ferrand 1840 Cognac
    - 1 ounce Sesame-Infused Rum (page 292)
    - ¼ ounce Lustau East India solera sherry
    - ¼ ounce Giffard Vanille de Madagascar

    author: Devon Tarby
    year: 2013
    notes: The Conference, a groundbreaking Old-Fashioned variation developed by former Death & Co head bartender Brian Miller, has a core that's divided between four different brown spirits. The Autumn Old-Fashioned is a richer, deeper expression of that drink. We usually like to use maple syrup as a sweetener when we combine this many big flavors; it has a brightness that keeps the spirits from becoming too heavy.
    ingredients:
    - ½ ounce George Dickel rye
    - ½ ounce Laird's 100-proof straight apple brandy
    - ½ ounce Tariquet VSOP Bas-Armagnac
    - ½ ounce Bank Note scotch
    - 1 teaspoon dark, robust maple syrup

    notes: This crystal clear drink tastes like minty dark chocolate, earning its place among what we like to call "mindfuck drinks." Vodka is a nontraditional base spirit for an Old-Fashioned-style drink for sure, but infusing it with cocoa butter and adding a splash of chocolate liqueur gives it the richness and complexity of an aged spirit. With a drink this rich and sweet, a bit of savory seasoning, in this case Salt Solution, is needed to brighten the flavors.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Cocoa Butter-Infused Absolut Elyx Vodka 
    - ¼ ounce Giffard white crème de cacao

    year: 2015
    notes: Developed for the inaugural Pacific Coast Highway-themed menu at the Walker Inn, the Beach Bonfire is designed to evoke the experience of sitting around a fire and taking alternating sips from a flask of whiskey and a cold beer. We start with our benchmark bourbon and add some cachaça for its chocolate and cinnamon notes, then sweeten the drink with pineapple syrup, which adds a nod to summer without making the drink taste tropical. At the bar, we'd hit the finished drink with a blast of hickory smoke before serving it next to a small glass of pilsner; at home you can skip the smoke and the beer if you like.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon 
    - ½ ounce Avuá Amburana cachaça
    - 1 teaspoon Pineapple Gum Syrup
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    - 1 dash Bittermens Xocolatl Mole Bitters
    - "Garnish: 1 dehydrated pineapple slice and a glass of pilsner"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into an Old-Fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube
    - Using a PolyScience Smoking Gun or something similar, shoot some hickory smoke over the drink to create just a whisper of smoke aroma (see page 274 for instructions)

    notes: A Champagne Cocktail is essentially an Old-Fashioned in which Champagne stands in for the whiskey. Because of the lower alcohol content of the Champagne, partially diluting the drink as you would an Old-Fashioned doesn't make sense, and, of course, the bubbles in the Champagne wouldn't be well served by stirring. Therefore, this drink is built in a flute. Given that it isn't stirred over ice, like an Old-Fashioned, be sure to start with cold Champagne.
    ingredients:
    - 1 sugar cube
    - Angostura bitters
    - Dry Champagne 
    - "Garnish: 1 lemon twist"
    steps:
    - Place the sugar cube on a paper towel
    - Dash the bitters over the sugar cube until it's completely saturated
    - Drop the sugar cube into a chilled flute and slowly top with Champagne; don't stir

    notes: Riffing on a Champagne Cocktail can be as easy as riffing on any other Old-Fashioned variation. In this case, the sugar is swapped out for a sweet liqueur. Combier is an orange curaçao, and the "royal" bottling has a base of Cognac, which provides a rich backbone. In a way, this variation lies somewhere between a classic Champagne Cocktail and an Old-Fashioned, being made with Armagnac and Champagne instead of whiskey.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Tariquet Classique VS Bas-Armagnac
    - ½ ounce Royal Combier

    notes: The combination of Cognac and Jamaican rum appears frequently in older cocktail recipes. Here, the duo creates a big, funky core flavor that plays off the bright fruit of the peach liqueur. The amaro acts as a bridge between these two opposing camps, working in much the same way bitters do, balancing other disparate flavors.

    notes: The baked stone fruit and warm autumn flavors of this cocktail make it a great option for an Old-Fashioned lover who's looking for something on the more refreshing side. We double down on pear, bringing the spirituous heat and pear-like gritty texture thanks to pear brandy and the supple fruitiness of the pear liqueur. The addition of Amaro Montenegro brings this drink into the aperitif category.

    notes: When we use an unaged spirit as the core of a cocktail, we often add other ingredients to mimic the flavors typically contributed by oak and time.

    notes: |
      Truly great cocktails become iconic. A Sazerac is such a drink. When you look at the Sazerac's 
      composition spirit, sugar, bitters, citrus-it's so obviously linked to the Old-Fashioned, yet 
      there are differences: While both are served in an Old-Fashioned glass, the Old Fashioned is 
      served on ice, whereas the Sazerac is served neat. The Old-Fashioned is garnished with twists 
      of citrus in the glass, whereas the Sazerac has a lemon twist expressed over the glass, but the
      twist is then discarded. Most dramatically, the Sazerac plays a trick on the drinker's senses: 
      Before the cocktail is poured, the glass is rinsed with absinthe, creating a pungent anise and 
      citrus aroma that persists until the glass is empty-an aroma that contrasts with the cool,
      boozy liquid below. It's this technique-rinsing the glass with a highly aromatic spirit-that 
      sets a Sazerac apart and defines it and the variations on it that follow. The Sazerac also 
      provides a good example of how classic cocktails evolved based on regionally available 
      ingredients. In the mid-1800s, the spirit of choice in Francophilic New Orleans-the Sazerac's 
      birthplace was Cognac, but by the end of the century a shortage of French brandy due to a 
      phylloxera outbreak that plagued France's vineyards shifted the Big Easy's focus to rye. New 
      Orleans-made Peychaud's bitters, with its distinctive anise flavor, has remained a constant, 
      but we've found that French absinthe and Angostura bitters are welcome additions to the 
      benchmark recipe.
    ingredients: 
    - Vieux Pontarlier absinthe
    - 1½ ounces Rittenhouse rye
    - ½ ounce Pierre Ferrand 1840 Cognac
    - 1 teaspoon Demerara Gum Syrup
    - 4 dashes Peychaud's bitters
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters 
    - "Garnish: 1 lemon twist"

    - Rinse an Old-Fashioned glass with absinthe and dump
    - Stir the remaining ingredients over ice, then strain into the glass
    - Express the lemon twist over the drink and discard

    notes: Although it's aged for eight years, the apple brandy in this drink doesn't taste much like an aged spirit, so we also include pot-distilled Irish whiskey, with its vanilla and spice flavors, in the core. And because Irish whiskey has a nice affinity for honey, we use a honey syrup for the sweetener, which keeps the drink light and crisp, whereas Demerara Gum Syrup would probably be too cloying.

    notes: In this cocktail, the tart bite of the cherry-infused rye whiskey is complemented by juiciness from the apple brandy, but alone those ingredients would come across as sweet and bland. However, just a couple of dashes of absinthe add an anise pop and complexity to the drink, accenting the tart and juicy flavors in an unexpected way-a great demonstration of the power of the seasoning.

    notes: The idea of putting bananas in a boozy cocktail once seemed questionable at best. Then the liqueur company Giffard introduced Banane du Brésil to the US market, a banana liqueur that far exceeded our expectations. When our team first tasted it, we were excited to find it balanced and characterized by a true banana flavor-a rarity in liqueurs. It's also very versatile. Here, it plays a supporting role, seasoning a boozy drink.

    notes: Replace the high-proof whiskey in an Old-Fashioned with a larger quantity of low-proof amontillado sherry, and swap muddled orange slices for the bitters, and you have a Cobbler. Amontillado sherry is a fortified wine that gives the cocktail both body and acidity, making it a strong backbone for the drink. When muddled, the orange wheels add not only a touch of sweetness from the flesh but also some seasoning from the bitter pith and the vibrant oils in the skin. This complexity is nicely counterbalanced by the levity and bright aroma of the fresh mint garnish. When it comes to the garnish, don't limit yourself to the orange wedge and mint called for here; an array of seasonal fruits is traditional, so play around with whatever fruits or herbs you have on hand. It's become an inside joke among our bartender friends to make the most ludicrous, overgarnished cobbler any time one of us requests one.

    notes: Almonds and stone fruits, such as apricots, peaches, and plums, are botanically related, and they tend to taste great together in cocktails. Amontillado sherry continues the nutty theme, while Cognac adds a bit of richness and proof. While fresh stone fruit can be a bit inconsistent in terms of sugar and acid, this template is nicely balanced to accommodate fruits of various ripeness.

    notes: Water is an often overlooked element of cocktails. In our Old-Fashioned, the water comes from a bit of dilution, both while stirring the ingredients over ice and as the chunk of ice in the cocktail melts a bit. A toddy, then, is really just an Old-Fashioned that swaps in hot water for cold. This takes the cocktail in a different direction for two key reasons. First, heat increases the perception of alcohol. If you were to take the same amount of water present in a properly diluted Old-Fashioned about 1 ounce-and warm it along with the spirit, sweetener, and bitters, you'd have a cocktail with an intensely alcoholic and unpleasant flavor. So for toddies the drink is lengthened. We've found that 4 ounces of water to 2 ounces of spirit is a good baseline. Second, alcohol evaporates when heated, so when you drink a hot toddy, the volatile aromas will rise to your nose before you take your first sip. This can be off-putting if the drink is too high in proof, but it also allows the drink maker to play with aromas, whether infused into a spirit or inherent in it. Calvados, for example, is ethereal when heated, with a warming perfume that's almost reminiscent of putting on a thick sweater. Because toddies are both heated and more diluted than other cocktails, they require a bit more sweetener and seasoning than Old-Fashioneds; otherwise, they feel thin. The small amount of lemon juice in the drink doesn't make it acidic; rather, it helps season the cocktail and bring the other components into harmony.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 lemon wedges
    - 1½ ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
    - ¾ ounce Honey Syrup
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    - 4 ounces boiling water
    - "Garnish: 2 lemon wedges and nutmeg"
    steps:
    - Squeeze the lemon wedges into a toddy mug, then add the remaining ingredients (except the water)
    - Pour in the boiling water, then grate some nutmeg over the top of the drink and garnish with the lemon wedges

    notes: Though we called out gin and vodka as the core of Martinis in the preceding section, we've also emphasized that the true core of these cocktails is a combination of spirit and aromatized wine. In the Vesper, the two core spirits are combined-something that works in this classic cocktail because of a corresponding shift in the balance, wherein the vermouth has been replaced with Lillet blanc. The Lillet has a similar alcohol content, but it adds a fruitier quality, as opposed to vermouth's savoriness, and its flavors are delicate enough that using just gin as the base-even a softer gin, like Plymouth-would overpower the drink. Replacing some of the gin with vodka helps to stretch out the gin's botanicals and allows the Lillet to shine.

      Splitting the base with other spirits can be an easy way to keep the form of the Martini 
      largely intact while creating an entirely new cocktail. The Dean Martin is a great example 
      of this strategy, replacing some of the gin with a highly flavorful Douglas fir brandy. 
      Because that changes the balance too, we added woodsy La Quintinye blanc vermouth to accent 
      the Douglas fir eau-de-vie. The result is a cocktail that answers the question that inspired 
      it: "What would a Martini consumed on a mountaintop in December taste like?"

    notes: This cocktail, in which fino sherry replaces the vermouth, offers a great example of how a fairly simple change to the balance calls for further adjustments. Because fino sherry is so dry, we've used more than the amount of vermouth called for in our root Vodka Martini recipe (page 62) and have also added a bit of honey syrup to give the cocktail greater body. Then, because sherry is a more delicate modifier than vermouth, in this cocktail we showcase the subtle texture of a wheat-based vodka—a quality that vermouth would overshadow. The final touch is a spritz of a mineral-rich sea salt solution, which gives the drink an added layer of briny aroma.

    notes: A more sensational way to change the balance is to infuse the aromatized wine with flavorings. This drink is a riff on the Vesper (page 71), in which an aromatized wine (Cocchi Americano bianco) is flavored with a few drops of root beer extract. On its own, the infused Cocchi is tasty, but when mixed into the cocktail it gets a little lost, so we add a bit of orange marmalade, which introduces a touch of sweetness and a pleasant bitterness that bridges the flavors and helps highlight the infused Cocchi.

    author: 
    notes: A Manhattan is basically a Martini that uses rye whiskey rather than gin, and sweet vermouth rather than dry. The yang to the Martini's yin, it nicely demonstrates how altering one element of a cocktail generally calls for other adjustments. Aged spirits, especially higher-proof ones, need to be paired with modifiers that can support their intensity without being smothered. If we were to simply substitute rye whiskey for gin in a Martini, the rye would overshadow the vermouth. Classic Angostura bitters connect the peppery rye and sweet vermouth, and offer yet another avenue for exploration, as you'll see in some of the variations that follow.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces Rittenhouse rye

    notes: In cocktail parlance, the term "perfect" refers to a drink that contains equal parts sweet and dry vermouth. Sounds easy enough, but splitting modifiers is tricky, especially in a Manhattan. If you use the wrong combination of vermouths, one (or both) will fight with the whiskey for attention. But in this recipe, the crispness of the dry vermouth, reinforced by the lemon twist garnish, results in a lighter, brighter Manhattan.

    notes: True, the Martini and its variations typically involve a simple harmony of spirit and vermouth, but as just mentioned, a host of cocktails in its extended family also include a small amount of liqueur. In the Martinez, just 1 teaspoon of maraschino liqueur brings both fruitiness and astringency, qualities that pair beautifully with the vanilla flavors in aged spirits and sweet vermouth. When coming up with Martinez variations, the liqueur is a great place to start, given that there are so many interesting choices to explore, from Bénédictine, which introduces a honeyed sweetness and herbal undertones, to fruit liqueurs, such as peach, apricot, or raspberry.
    ingredients: 
    - 1½ ounces Hayman's Old Tom gin
    - 1½ ounces Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth
    - 1 teaspoon Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur
    - 2 dashes House Orange Bitters

    notes: We often say that bitter and sweet ingredients can act as a glue, binding disparate components of a drink together, and this cocktail provides a great example. Small amount of two liqueurs—bittersweet China-China Amer and rich apricot liqueur—marry the vodka with not one but two sherries, giving this drinks quiet backbone of dried fruit and nuts with a pleasant lingering bitterness.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces Grey Goose vodka

      Here’s a complex, Martinez-style drink that uses a soft scotch and a rich, spicy contemporary 
      gin in place of the traditional Old Tom gin. This is a great example of the value of knowing 
      your ingredients: The unique sarsaparilla flavors of the Aviation gin marry well with the 
      cola notes found in both the sweet Spanish vermouth and the Ramazzotti amaro; substituting 
      another brand of any of these ingredients will yield markedly different results.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 ounce Highland Park 12-year scotch
    - 1 ounce Aviation gin
    - ½ ounce Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth
    - ¼ ounce Giffard Abricot du Roussillon

    notes: Another strategy for experimenting with the balance is to substitute small amounts of amari or liqueurs for a portion of the vermouth or aromatized wine. The most classic example of this is the Brooklyn, a riff on the Manhattan that uses a bit of amaro and just a teaspoon of maraschino liqueur. Despite its Manhattan-adjacent name, you can quickly recognize this drink as a rye-based variation on the Martinez (page 86) because of the liqueur. Though the Brooklyn was historically made with Amer Picon, an orange flavored French liqueur, modern bottlings of Amer Picon-if you can even find them-are less bitter and flavorful than older versions, so in its place we use China-China Amer, a bittersweet aperitif crafted with the classic Amer Picon recipe in mind.

    notes: As you may recall from the Improved Whiskey Cocktail, the term improved refers to adding a bit of highly flavorful liqueur to a basic cocktail. This is a valuable way of thinking about how seemingly minor adjustments can create distinctive new variations. In the Poet's Dream, a basic Martini is "improved" by backing off on the vermouth a bit and including a bit of herbaceous Bénédictine.

    notes: Before creating this drink, we'd only encountered Calvados in drinks as a base spirit. In this Martinez variation, a small amount of Calvados softens the Old Tom gin and adds a fruity depth to the drink, while a touch of Strega adds complexity, acting much like bitters. All the (pre-Brexit) European friends in one glass.

      When you glance at this drink's ingredients, you might expect a savory cocktail to emerge, 
      but using a centrifuge to make the Watercress Infused Gin releases all of the plant's peppery 
      flavors without making the gin taste like a liquid salad. Don't have a centrifuge? No sweat: 
      just lightly muddle a few watercress leaves with the vermouths and peach liqueur, then remove 
      them and build the cocktail. Just as you might add dried fruit to a salad of bitter greens, 
      here we add a small measure of a peach liqueur to add a fruity complexity to the cocktail.

    notes: |
      By and large, the cocktails in this chapter are characterized by a core flavor of spirit and 
      vermouth or another aromatized wine, and generally speaking, they fail when those components 
      aren't in balance. However, there is an exception to this rule (as there always is): the 
      Negroni, a deeply bitter cocktail made with a full ounce of Campari. Because Campari brings a 
      lot of proof to the drink, the Negroni has less gin, and it finds its balance in the typical 
      core of gin and vermouth, but in an equal parts combination in which the amaro is a unified 
      part of the core, with the gin providing a clean structure upon which the bitterness of 
      Campari is balanced by the richness of the sweet vermouth. In the variations that follow, 
      you'll find a few other cocktails that employ a similar tactic, substituting high-alcohol 
      liqueurs or other amari for the Campari, and adjusting the balance of ingredients so they 
      harmonize as a whole.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 ounce Tanqueray London Dry gin

      Is this a tequila-laced Perfect Manhattan (page 86) with the addition of Campari, or a 
      tequila Negroni that splits the vermouths? Either way, the addition of dry vermouth is 
      key in our version of Gary Regan's adaptation of a recipe found in an old copy of Mr. Boston: 
      Official Bartender's Guide, as the savory flavors of the Dolin blanc amplify the vegetal 
      quality of the tequila.

      The Boulevardier dates back to the 1920s, when it made an appearance in Barflies and 
      Cocktails, a seminal cocktail book written by Harry MacElhone, the owner of Harry's New York 
      Bar in Paris. The original recipe called for equal portions of each ingredient, a ratio that 
      has shifted, over the years, in favor of whiskey. Now that you understand the basic orthodoxy 
      of the Martini (and, likewise, the Negroni), this shouldn't come as a surprise: although a 
      perfectly delicious Boulevardier can be made with equal measures, using more bourbon and less 
      Campari and vermouth promotes the whiskey's flavor just enough that it asserts itself.
    ingredients: 
    - 1½ ounces Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
    - ¾ ounce Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth
    - ¾ ounce Campari
    - "Garnish: 1 brandied cherry"

      If there's one unifying theme among all the Martini variations in this chapter thus far, it's 
      that they're very boozy. But here's an iteration that's lower in ABV while still reflecting 
      the spirit of the Martini: the classic Bamboo, which swaps out gin for amontillado sherry. 
      Because the sherry is lower in alcohol and not as pungently flavored as gin, the proportion 
      of vermouth is increased to balance the cocktail-the vermouths surround the sherry and add 
      sweetness and depth of flavor. The Bamboo is a very old drink, having originated in Japan in 
      the late nineteenth century, but it remains one of our favorite cocktails today-so much so 
      that we often serve it on tap at our bars.
    ingredients: 
    - 1½ ounces Lustau Los Arcos Amontillado Sherry
    - ¾ ounce Dolin blanc vermouth 
    - ¾ ounce Dolin dry vermouth

    notes: What would it taste like to drink wine while standing in a Sonoma farm? To answer the question that inspired this riff on the Bamboo, we start with a fruity Chardonnay and add a touch of sweet honey; the bright grapey acidity of verjus; and Calvados, an apple brandy native to Normandy, France, another bucolic agricultural region. Topping it off is a spray of a white pepper aroma, which has the distinct smell of a barn.

    notes: A lighter, brighter riff on the Bamboo, this is our take on a root-to-stem cocktail that uses the entire Meyer lemon. We combine the ingredients and infuse the cocktail with the fruit's fragrant zest, then we use the leftover juice to make a Meyer lemon cordial that can be made into a carbonated soda and served alongside this cocktail. The recipe below makes about 1 liter—the perfect sophisticated and refreshing aperitif for a party. Serves 10.
    ingredients: 
    - 12 ounces Lustau Puerto fino sherry
    - 6 ounces Dolin blanc vermouth
    - 6 ounces Dolin dry vermouth 
    - 4 ounces Campo de Encanto Moscatel pisco
    - Zest from 2 Meyer lemons 
    - 1¼ ounces Cane Sugar Syrup
    - 8 dashes House Orange Bitters
    - 8 ounces water 
    - "Garnish: 10 Meyer lemon wheels"
    steps:
    - Combine half of the sherry, vermouths, pisco, and zest in an iSi whipper (see page 97)
    - Following the pressure infusion method explained on page 97, infuse the mixture
    - Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and transfer to a large bowl
    - Repeat with the remaining sherry, vermouths, pisco, and zest
    - Add the syrup, bitters, and water to the mixture and stir to combine, then transfer to a 1-liter bottle
    - Seal and refrigerate until cold
    - Serve in chilled coupes (this recipe makes ten drinks), garnished with the Meyer lemon wheels

      Some drinks benefit from using a combination of lemon and lime juices: lemon for its mild 
      flavor and lime for its brightness. For our take on the classic Pisco Sour, this is exactly 
      what we do, as we've found that this cocktail isn't nearly as delicious when we use just one 
      or the other. The pungency of the lime juice plays well with the gritty texture of the pisco, 
      and the relative neutrality of lemon juice prevents the lime from taking over.

    notes: Grapefruit juice has a delicious bitter-tart flavor that makes it one of our favorite alternatives to lemon and lime juice in cocktails. To get an idea of how grapefruit juice affects the balance of a drink, we'll break down the classic Hemingway Daiquiri. Because grapefruit juice isn't as acidic as lime juice, simply substituting 1 ounce of it for the lime juice in our root Daiquiri recipe would yield a thin cocktail. And as you can see, the recipe for this classic variation also contains a somewhat generous amount of lime juice. Then, because both the grapefruit juice and the maraschino liqueur add sweetness, the amount of simple syrup is dialed way back. This drink is very much about the relationship between rum, grapefruit juice, and maraschino liqueur, but it gets its amazing vibrancy from the lime juice and simple syrup.

      Former Death & Co head bartender Brian Miller's reworked recipe set the stage for this 
      version of our own. A tiki-head of unquenchable enthusiasm, Brian meticulously studied the 
      Zombie form and built a delicious (and highly potent) cocktail (see our first book, 
      "Death & Co: Modern Classic Cocktails" for the recipe). Our homage backs off slightly on the 
      booze (only a little!) and tweaks the rum mix a bit. Depending on the availability of rum in 
      your area, the key is to ensure the mix of a Jamaican rum, an aged Spanish style rum, and 
      aged 151 rum (also known as firewater). Drink with caution.
    ingredients: 
    - 1¼ ounces Appleton Estate Signature Blend rum
    - 1¼ ounces Ron del Barrilito 3-Star rum
    - ¾ ounce Hamilton Demerara 151 Overproof rum
    - ½ ounce Donn's Mix No 1
    - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ½ ounce Tailor Velvet Falernum
    - 1 teaspoon House Grenadine
    - 2 dashes Pernod Absinthe
    - "Garnish: Mint sprig, 1 cherry, 1 orange slice, 1 parasol, and 1 pineapple wedge"
    steps:
    - Shake all the ingredients with ice, then strain into a Zombie-size tiki mug filled with crushed ice
    - Garnish with the mint sprig, cherry, orange slice, parasol, and pineapple wedge

    notes: In bartending circles, there's an ongoing debate about whether this classic Daiquiri variation should be made with lemon juice or lime juice. Frankly, it's delicious either way, but we lean toward lime for its brightness when combined with mint. The Southside is similar to our Fresh Gimlet but even more refreshing thanks to the muddled mint. It's also slightly more complex because it includes a dash of bitters.

    notes: The Daiquiri template is so simple that riffing on it is easy. One of our favorite starting points is to introduce another rum or spirit as part of the core. Here, we replace a bit of the rum with rich, smooth Cognac, then bolster the aged character of the Cognac with a spiced syrup. When choosing the citrus for this drink, it could be tempting to use lemon juice because it would complement the Cognac and cinnamon so well. The result would be a decent drink, but lime juice cuts through the cinnamon and Cognac and imparts an unexpected astringency, keeping the drink bright and refreshing.

    notes: The Boukman Daiquiri highlights an interesting way to play with the sour template - by substituting a flavorful syrup for the simple syrup. A good rule of thumb for matching flavorful syrups with citrus is that lemon juice has a soft acidity that doesn't distract from honey, whereas lime juice brings an astringency that can cut through a dense syrup or heighten the flavors in a syrup. If honey were paired with lime juice in this classic cocktail, its flavor would disappear into the background.

    notes: You can think of this classic cocktail as a mash-up between the Bee's Knees and the Jack Rose. Gin and a bit of apple brandy make up the core and are enhanced by juicy-tart grenadine. Lime juice would overpower the gin, whereas lemon acts as a soft bridge between the gin, brandy, and grenadine. The Pink Lady is also a good lesson in restraint; if it simply used a full ¾ ounce of grenadine in place of the simple syrup in the basic sour template, the cocktail would be all about the grenadine; instead, it calls for just ½ ounce of grenadine and supplements it with simple syrup. Why only ½ ounce of lemon juice? Grenadine also has some acidity, and combined with the drying effect of egg white, a full ¾ ounce of lemon juice would create a tongue-strippingly dry cocktail.

    notes: In many cases, pairing an aged spirit like bourbon with lime juice yields results that are less than pleasant. Try making a Basic Sour with whiskey and lime juice, and you'll see what we mean; the same properties that make bourbon so tasty—vanilla, spice, tannins—don't play well with the high acidity, astringency, and flavor of lime juice. That's why recipes for cocktails like the classic Whiskey Sour generally call for lemon juice rather than lime.

    notes: In this cocktail, as in the Kentucky Maid, a bit of highly herbaceous mint helps bridge the gap between seemingly mismatched aged spirits and lime juice-a function also served by the absinthe in this recipe. Note that this cocktail and the Smokescreen (page 132) have exactly the same ingredients with the exception of the accent-absinthe in this case and Chartreuse in the Smokescreen. Even though only small amounts of these two accents are used, the end result is two very different flavor profiles, showing how something simple and seemingly minor can make a world of difference in a cocktail's flavor.

      The Pompadour explores another way to riff on a Basic Sour: by incorporating a low-ABV 
      ingredient as part of a split base, in this case, the French aperitif Pineau des Charentes. 
      As you can see, the volume of the Pineau des Charentes is higher than if a boozy spirit were 
      swapped into the split base. The Pompadour strikes a great balance between the power of rhum 
      agricole, the juiciness of the Pineau des Charentes, and the sweet roundness of vanilla.

    notes: The Smokescreen follows the same model as the Smoke and Mirrors, but gets its herbaceousness from green Chartreuse instead of absinthe. Whereas the absinthe gives the Smoke and Mirrors an anise undertone that contrasts with the smoky scotch, the Chartreuse gives the Smokescreen a savory quality thanks to its grassy, tarragon-like flavor, which draws out the Laphroaig scotch's vegetal side.

    notes: Despite the conventional wisdom that lemon juice is a better partner for aged spirits than lime juice, well-chosen ingredients can be used to bridge these kinds of conflicting elements, leading to delicious and surprising combinations. One of our favorite examples of this is the Kentucky Maid, concocted by the legendary barman Sam Ross. Here, bourbon and lime are bridged by muddled cucumber and mint, resulting in an unexpectedly refreshing cocktail. The cucumber adds juiciness similar to how lemon would, and the mint provides herbaceous seasoning. Without question, the Kentucky Maid is our go-to "welcome to bourbon" cocktail—we haven't met anyone who doesn't like it.

In the High Five, we use a very similar formula but substitute gin as the core.

    notes: When paired with robust aged spirits, grapefruit juice acts differently than it does when combined with lighter liquors. Whereas spirits like rum and gin enhance the refreshing flavor of grapefruit, aged spirits tend to draw out some of the denser flavors and sweetness in the juice. Though the classic recipe for a Brown Derby doesn't call for any citrus beyond the grapefruit juice, we like to add just a bit of lemon juice to cut through some of the richness of the syrup, which might otherwise overshadow the brightness of the grapefruit juice.

    notes: |
      While the Mojito is certainly a member of the Daiquiri extended family, using similar 
      proportions of the same ingredients-rum, lime juice, and sweetener-the fact that it's served 
      over crushed ice makes it a distant cousin, at least in our eyes. Introducing crushed ice 
      into the equation means it's necessary to think about how the cocktail will evolve after it's 
      served. The key is to pack the ice into the glass, using a greater volume of ice than the 
      volume of the cocktail. This will keep the cocktail cold and also keep the ice from moving 
      around. Why should it matter if the ice moves around? If it does, dilution will occur more 
      rapidly and the cocktail will quickly become a watery mess. To avoid this, we take a few 
      precautions when building Mojitos and their variations. First, we use a glass that can hold 
      both a full cocktail and an appropriate amount of ice. Either a Collins glass or a double 
      Old-Fashioned glass that can hold at least 16 ounces will fit the bill. Second, we freeze the 
      glass so it's extremely cold when the cocktail is poured in. Third, instead of shaking the 
      drink, we use a technique called whipping: shaking the drink with a few pieces of crushed 
      ice—just enough to mix the ingredients without diluting them too much. After all, there's no 
      need to chill the cocktail as much as one served neat, since it's served over so much crushed 
      ice, which will also serve the function of diluting the drink. Fourth and finally, after we 
      pour the drink into the glass, we add crushed ice to fill the glass about four-fifths full, 
      then stir or swizzle for a few seconds, and then pack the glass with ice, mounding the ice on 
      top, like a snow cone. The end result should be a glass full of crushed ice, all the way to 
      the bottom, with an even distribution of liquid, and a cone of crushed ice above the wash line.

    notes: As discussed earlier in this chapter, citrus skins are loaded with flavorful oils. These can be expressed from twists, but they can also be incorporated via muddling. The Brazilian Caipirinha, which includes almost an entire lime, provides a great opportunity to consider the finer details of muddling citrus. When we cut lime wedges to garnish a drink, we do so in such a way that they're easy to squeeze into a cocktail, cutting them into wedges from the top to the bottom of the lime. But for muddling, we prefer to cut them into pieces of a size and shape that make it easy to extract both the juice and the oils in the skin with one even pressing. So first we cut the lime in half across the middle, then we place the halves on a cutting board cut side down and slice them into quarters. The lime is then muddled with sugar, which helps extract flavor from the lime skin. We prefer to use a sugar cube because it cuts into the lime skin to bring out more of its oils. We recommend putting the sugar cube in a small shaker tin, then adding the lime and simple syrup. Muddle each piece of lime by pressing down and twisting slightly to flatten the lime and break down the sugar. Stop muddling as soon as all of the pieces have been crushed. Although we're typically militant about never pouring the ice we shake a cocktail with into the serving glass, we make an exception for the Caipirinha, which is traditionally served with not just the ice, but also the muddled lime. This allows the lime to continue to flavor the cocktail—though they can get bitter, we find that it's a pleasant limey flavor that builds toward the end of the cocktail. The brightly colored citrus also looks beautiful in a glass.

      Another type of drink in the Daiquiri's extended family is sours that have bubbly ingredients 
      added. This is such a broad category that it has several subfamilies: Collins-style drinks, 
      fizzes, and numerous cocktails that include sparkling wine. We'll start with the Collins, 
      which is basically a sour served in a tall glass with ice and seltzer. The biggest challenge 
      in preparing a Collins is avoiding over-dilution. We like our Collinses as fizzy as possible, 
      so rather than shaking them to full dilution, as for sours, we short shake them-just long 
      enough to chill the ingredients without adding too much dilution, about five seconds. This 
      leaves more room for the seltzer. Traditionally, Collins-style drinks are topped with seltzer 
      that isn't stirred into the drink. We view this as less than ideal. When the drink is sipped 
      through a straw, the experience is often like drinking a sour that gradually dilutes and may 
      not be bubbly at all. Our preferred method is to add a measured portion of seltzer to the 
      empty serving glass, then pour in the contents of the shaker, an action that effectively 
      mixes the cocktail, and then add ice at the very end-no stirring required. To make the best 
      Collins, use seltzer that's as cold as possible: keep it refrigerated and sealed before use 
      or, better yet, build a carbonating rig and make your own very cold and highly sparkling 
      seltzer (see page 232). Room temperature seltzer is a waste of time; the bubbles will escape 
      quickly and the seltzer will become flat. Add this to a drink and you're really just diluting 
      it.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces cold seltzer
    - 2 ounces Beefeater London Dry gin
    - 1 ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - "Garnish: 1 orange half wheel and 1 brandied cherry on a skewer"
    steps:
    - Pour the seltzer into a Collins glass
    - Short shake the remaining ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into the glass

    notes: When experimenting with the Collins template, keep in mind that seltzer contains a bit of carbonic acid, which increases the perception of acidity. For this reason, we often use a 1-to-1 ratio of citrus juice to sweetener in Collins-style cocktails unless we want an extra-tart drink (which we do for the basic Collins, but when adding other flavors we tend to back off on the acid). In the Grapefruit Collins, the grapefruit juice has a balanced sweet tart flavor, so we remove it from the equation and then use equal amounts of lemon juice and simple syrup.

    - 2 ounces cold seltzer

    notes: The Parachute is a great example of building a Collins-style cocktail on a low-proof base, here split between a juicy white port and the slightly bitter Salers aperitif. Because each of these ingredients has a powerful flavor, this cocktail drinks much like a full-proof sour but doesn't carry such a strong alcohol punch.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces cold tonic water 
    - 1 ounce Quinta do Infantado white port
    - 1 ounce Salers Gentiane

      The Moscow Mule is famous for good reason: it has a strong ginger bite and is unquestionably 
      refreshing. You may notice that this recipe uses slightly less lime juice than a typical 
      sour-style cocktail. We do this to honor the original recipe, which was just a simple mixture 
      of vodka and ginger beer topped with a squeeze of lime—more a Highball than a sour. In 
      addition, ginger's powerful flavor has a zip somewhat like citrus, so when we use it, we 
      often back down on any lemon or lime juice in the cocktail to let it shine.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces cold seltzer
    - 2 ounces vodka
    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ¾ ounce House Ginger Syrup
    - "Garnish: 1 lime wheel and 1 piece of candied ginger on a skewer"
    steps:
    - Pour the seltzer into a Collins glass
    - Short shake the remaining ingredients with ice for about 5 seconds, then strain into the glass

    notes: In the Moscow Mule, the vodka core keeps the cocktail clearly focused on the interplay between ginger, lime juice, and the fizziness of seltzer. If a more flavorful spirit is used, the proportion of ingredients may need to be adjusted-a principle that's clearly illustrated in our version of the Dark and Stormy (which, like the Moscow Mule, was traditionally made with ginger beer). To balance the rich molasses flavor of Gosling's Black Seal rum, we up the amounts of both the ginger syrup and the lime juice.

    - 2 ounces cold seltzer
    - 2 ounces Gosling's Black Seal rum

    notes: At their simplest, fizzes are basically Collins-style drinks served without ice. Although fizzes are most commonly associated with gin, they can be made with any spirit. This classic cocktail, the Silver Fizz, is a simple fizz to which an egg white has been added. When the cocktail is shaken, the egg white's tightly packed proteins unfold and trap air, forming bubbles. When the drink is then topped with seltzer even more frothiness ensues, as those proteins wrap around the carbon dioxide bubbles to create a light and fluffy foam.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces Beefeater London Dry gin
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - 1 egg white
    - 2 ounces cold seltzer
    steps:
    - Dry shake all the ingredients (except the seltzer), then shake again with ice
    - Double strain into a fizz glass
    - Slowly add the seltzer, occasionally tapping the bottom of the glass on a table or flat surface to settle the foam
    - As you finish adding the seltzer, a white puck of foam should form on top of the drink

    notes: Perhaps the most famous of the fizzes is the Ramos Gin Fizz, a New Orleans cocktail wherein the clean simplicity of a Silver Fizz is enriched with heavy cream. Traditionally, it's shaken for a full ten minutes to create a light, ethereal texture that's like a boozy liquid cloud. We've never found a full ten-minute shake to be necessary (it's more theater than necessary); five minutes is more than enough to create the airy lightness needed for the Ramos. (See page 265 for the N₂O Ramos Gin Fizz, a version made in a whipper canister.)
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces Fords gin

The classic Presbyterian is similar to the Moscow Mule (page 139) and the Dark and Stormy (page 140), being simply spirit combined with ginger ale. But in this case, the core spirit is rye whiskey, seasoned with lemon juice. For our version, we include both lemon juice, for its sweet and refreshing flavor, and lime juice, for its pleasant astringency.

    notes: |
      The legendary bartender Audrey Saunders created this deeply complex cocktail that livens up a 
      Mojito with bubbles. To add greater complexity, Audrey relies on a lightly aged rum and 
      seasons with Angostura bitters and mint, creating a drink that is both refreshing and 
      sophisticated. We love the Old Cuban because it evolves as you drink it: with the first sips, 
      you're met with tongue-tingling effervescence and fresh mint flavors. As the cocktail warms 
      and the bubbles lose a bit of their intensity, the rum's richness comes to the front in a 
      soothing way.
    ingredients: 
    - 1½ ounces Bacardi 8-year aged rum
    - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
    - 1 ounce simple syrup
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 6 mint leaves
    - 2 ounces cold dry Champagne 
    - "Garnish: 1 mint leaf"

    - Shake all the ingredients (except the sparkling wine) with ice, then double strain into a chilled coupe
    - Pour in the Champagne, and quickly dip the barspoon into the glass to gently mix the wine with the cocktail

    notes: Yes, Champagne does make everything better, including a Collins! Some bartenders prepare a French 75 in a tall glass with ice like a Collins, but we opt for the swankier version in a flute. Either way, introducing Champagne (or a similar style of sparkling wine) changes the cocktail's balance, adding both proof and flavor. Therefore, the formula for this classic cocktail calls for decreased amounts of all three elements of the sour base—in our version, half the gin, and two-thirds of the lemon juice and simple syrup.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 ounce Plymouth gin
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice

    notes: Beer and cider can also be used to add effervescence to Collins-style drinks. Because these ingredients can vary widely in alcohol content, flavor, sweetness, and acidity, using them requires careful attention to adjusting the amounts of the base spirit, citrus juice, and sweetener. In the Accidental Guru, just 1 ounce of strong spirit (whiskey) is used and the citrus juice is dialed back a bit. Less sweetener is also used, in this case because the drink is enhanced with peach liqueur.

      What's the first thing you taste? We're guessing it's booze. This spec packs a hell of a 
      punch, and though that's not necessarily a bad thing, alcohol dominates the flavor profile, 
      creating a harsh, bitter drink. This is a widespread problem in cocktail making: ignoring the 
      proof of higher ABV modifying ingredients, like Cointreau, and simply substituting them for a 
      sweetener without adjusting the ratios. At 80 proof, Cointreau is just as boozy as most base 
      spirits, and while its sweetness will curb some of the effects of the lemon juice, the 
      resulting cocktail is far too dry. That's why the classic Sidecar recipe calls for less 
      Cognac, along with slightly more Cointreau, to provide a bit more sweetness. So, even if 
      you've already made the classic recipe at the beginning of the chapter, make it again so you 
      can do a side-by-side comparison.

    notes: Another instructive example of simple core substitution is the White Lady, an established riff on the Sidecar that plugs in gin for the Cognac. As with the Margarita, if the amounts of ingredients remain true to the Sidecar template, the gin would be overshadowed by the orange liqueur and have a punishing astringency. So to rebalance this classic cocktail, we increase the amount of gin to boost its personality, back off on the Cointreau, and add a bit of simple syrup. The White Lady also illustrates how egg white affects a cocktail and impacts the drinker's perception of balance. Though we cover the use of egg whites elsewhere (see pages 253 and 264), within the Sidecar family they can take on another dimension. Because the egg white's frothiness expands the drink's overall volume, it spreads the cocktail's flavor throughout that volume.

In this cocktail, it's paired with Paul Beau Cognac, chosen specifically for its textural earthiness, reminiscent of pear skin. A hint of cinnamon spice in the form of a syrup brings warmth that rounds off the sharp boozy edges.

    notes: Low-ABV cocktails are becoming more popular, for a variety of good reasons. For our part, we admit that we love being able to enjoy multiple drinks in a session without getting too tipsy, and the same is true for many of our guests. One approach to creating them is to split the core between a larger portion of fortified wine and a small measure of strong spirits. In a Sidecar, the strong spirit can then work with a flavorful liqueur to balance and season the drink. Note that because fortified wine often has some sweetness, it may be necessary to use a bit less liqueur.

    notes: Swap rich crème de cacao for the Cointreau—and a little Lillet blanc to stretch out the sweetness of the cacao—and you've got yourself the 20th Century, a chocolaty cocktail that doesn't taste like liquid dessert. (You'll notice that this cocktail calls for a full ½ ounces of gin-an adjustment that's necessary because crème de cacao is sweeter and lower in proof than Cointreau.) Thanks to the bright botanicals from the gin and the acidity from both the lemon juice and the Lillet blanc, the drink gives the impression of fruity cacao nibs, rather than a decadent chocolate bar.

    notes: The classic Last Word uses intensely herbaceous green Chartreuse and funky maraschino liqueur in place of the Cointreau. The two liqueurs are front and center and bring a lot of proof to the cocktail, thereby requiring the gin be reduced in proportion. In this case, the green Chartreuse and maraschino are both the dominant flavor, bringing sweetness to the cocktail and balancing the acidity of the lime juice, while the gin helps dry the cocktail out.

    notes: In this cocktail, we've modified the Last Word (see left), which packs a serious punch, to create a subtler, lighter cocktail. We use an amaro as part of the base, resulting in a drink that's significantly more refreshing than the dense Last Word. Its flavor combination, grapefruit-laden pamplemousse combined with the cinnamon spice notes of Amaro Montenegro, was directly inspired by Donn's Mix No. 1, a classic tiki syrup made with grapefruit juice and cinnamon syrup.

    notes: A Whiskey Sour meets a Sidecar in the Why Not. Though a simple Sidecar made with whiskey would be a balanced and tasty drink, we substitute maple syrup for half of the Cointreau to add not only sweetness but also rich flavor, and opt for the herbal aroma of a sage leaf garnish. The result is a refreshing cocktail that's perfect for fall and winter.

    notes: All Carrie Bradshaw jokes aside, it's hard to hate the Cosmopolitan. A Cosmo is beautifully refreshing, and if ever there was a gateway drink that led people to explore other cocktails, this would be the one. It also provides a great demonstration of how an established template can quickly be transformed into an entirely new cocktail. The Cosmo is a Sidecar that swaps citrus vodka for the Cognac and lime juice for the lemon, with a small amount of cranberry juice added. Where this drink can and often does go wrong is in using cranberry cocktail and adding too much of it. This makes the whole thing a sweet mess, which may be tasty for people unaccustomed to strong spirits, but it robs the cocktail of complexity, sophistication, and balance. Though cranberry cocktail is the ingredient originally called for in Cosmopolitans, we encourage you to try a version made with pure, unsweetened cranberry juice. Admittedly, it is very tannic and behaves quite differently in cocktails, so for our version, we balance the cranberry juice with an equal amount of simple syrup, and then increase the amount of vodka slightly to help it punch through the tart sweetness.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces citrus vodka 
    - ¾ ounce Cointreau
    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
    - 1½ ounce pure, unsweetened cranberry juice

    notes: To make our ideal Cosmopolitan, we stick with high-quality ingredients and use clarified lime juice to mimic the clarity of what most folks know as a "Cosmo," minus the Rose's Lime Juice and crappy cranberry cocktail. In addition to using pure cranberry juice, we forgo flavored vodka and impart citrus flavor by shaking the drink with lemon and lime twists. This is a more flexible approach that allows us to accommodate guests who request a preferred brand of vodka.

    - 1¼ ounces vodka

    notes: Blanc vermouth can act like a liqueur in shaken cocktails due to its sugar content. Here, it partners with Chareau-an aloe-based liqueur to serve as the liqueur element in this Sidecar variation. Because Chareau is so dry, we increase the amount of sweetener to add body to the cocktail.

    notes: Highly potent bitters can also be added to a cocktail to help adjust the balance. As you can see, this recipe follows the same basic template as our version of Between the Sheets (page 168). Gin acts in a supporting role to Cointreau's juicy flavor and sweetness, and so by adding a dash each of both Angostura and House Orange bitters, we are able to introduce seasoning that dries out the cocktail a bit while curbing the sharpness of the lime.

    notes: In the classic Champs-Élysées, green Chartreuse replaces the Cointreau in a Sidecar. Because Chartreuse is high proof (110% ABV) and intensely herbaceous, the formula must be adjusted accordingly. As you can see, the amount of liqueur is dialed back. In addition, the amount of Cognac is increased slightly, and simple syrup is added to help push the cocktail back into balance.

    notes: When a liqueur drives the flavor of the cocktail, this usually requires some changes to the citrus. In the Four to the Floor, a variation on the Corpse Reviver #2, the base is a beautiful marriage of pisco and grapefruit liqueur, so we opt to replace the more acidic citrus juice, which would overshadow those flavors, with verjus. Technique comes into play here, with the finished cocktail having a smooth, silky texture because it's stirred, whereas shaking would introduce air bubbles.

    notes: The classic Fish House Punch is clearly related to the Sidecar, containing Cognac, liqueur, and lemon juice in proportions quite similar to those in the Sidecar. The key difference is that it also includes seltzer, which increases the perception of acidity—much like our discussion of the Collins in the Daiquiri chapter. In this case, the classic recipe already includes ample richness in the core spirits and sweet peach liqueur, and the syrup bolsters those ingredients to increase the drink's body.
    ingredients:

    - ¾ ounce Appleton Estate Reserve Blend rum
    - ¾ ounce Giffard Crème de Pêche de Vigne

    notes: No exploration of the Sidecar's extended family would be complete without the infamous Long Island Iced Tea.

The amounts of Cointreau and lemon juice, however, aren't increased, so the added cola contributes a burst of sugar and acidity to bring the whole thing into balance.

      A staple aperitif cocktail, the Americano is like a Negroni (a member of the Martini family, page 89) in which the gin has been replaced with seltzer, transforming it into a Highball with a split base of Campari and sweet vermouth. Both ingredients are rich and bitter, even though they're lower in alcohol, which allows this basic Highball format to work without any modifications. That said, the orange garnish is important for this cocktail: it perfumes the nose, and its flavors slowly seep into the drink as it's consumed. We highly recommend having extra cold seltzer on hand to frequently top off an Americano, ideally in the late afternoon with a good book.

      In the classic Cuba Libre, a humble Highball-rum and Coke-is elevated by adding a touch of lime juice. It's an inspired choice, because lime peel is a key ingredient in most colas, so the juice draws that flavor out of the cola while also cutting through its sweetness. The core spirit is also crucial to making this cocktail work: rum's sugarcane backbone complements the cola's round spice flavors, and whisky's spice can work wonderfully with cola's bitter and citrus flavors, but the subtlety of vodka would fall flat, and gin's botanicals would clash with the mixer.

      By now you know that we're big proponents of using fresh juices. But for years, we were confounded by tomato juice, since fresh versions have a thin flavor and tend to separate when mixed with booze. The answer, as it turns out, is to mix fresh tomato juice with a bit of bottled juice to stabilize the texture while still delivering fresh tomato flavor, so that's the approach we take in the Bloody Mary mix for this cocktail. Another pet peeve of ours is Bloody Marys with a grainy texture or particulates, such as spices or horseradish. So for this Bloody Mary mix, we forgo spices or horseradish and instead use a bit of fresh celery juice and bell pepper juice. With so much work dedicated to perfecting the mix, we chose savory aquavit to deepen the flavor even more. This mix is versatile, though: swap in vodka, gin, or even amontillado sherry.

Use this recipe as a template and adjust the drink to suit your preferences. It's also a great canvas for experimentation. You could add a splash of mezcal for smoke, or substitute manzanilla sherry for the vodka to up the savory ante and bring the ABV down (you don't have to get drunk at brunch). Or consider making it with our Roasted Garlic- and Pepper-Infused Vodka (page 292).
    ingredients: 
    - Kosher salt and pepper, for rimming
    - Lemon wedge
    - 2 ounces Aylesbury Duck vodka 
    - 5 ounces Basic Bloody Mary Mix  
    - ¼ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - "Garnish: 1 lemon wedge and 1 celery stalk"
    steps:
    - On a small plate, mix equal parts of salt and pepper
    - Rub the lemon wedge along the upper ¼ inch of a pint glass, halfway around the circumference, then roll the wet portion in the salt and pepper
    - Fill the glass with ice cubes
    - Add the remaining ingredients and stir a few times
    - Garnish with the lemon wedge and celery stalk

    notes: Call us classicists, but we don't often veer away from the tomato-based Bloody Mary mixes used in the previous cocktails. One exception is our tomatillo-based Verde Mix, which is the perfect match for a spicy infused tequila. This drink needs more sugar than you'd think, as cucumber and tomatillo are naturally less sweet than tomatoes, so we add honey to the mix, which also adds a slight earthiness that helps unify the rest of the ingredients.

    - Kosher salt and chile powder, for rimming
    - Lime wedge
    - 5 ounces Verde Mix (page 296)

    notes: Nobody's Robots is a nerdy evolution of the Screwdriver made especially delicious by carbonating the entire cocktail. If you're equipped with a keg cocktail system (most people are, right?), this drink is a fantastic way to trick folks into drinking lots and lots of sherry. Overall, the flavors in this drink are more concentrated than those in a more typical Highball—a simple slug of booze topped with a mixer—which makes it feel more like a sophisticated cocktail.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 ounces Absolut vodka
    - 1 ounce Williams & Humbert Dry Sack sherry
    - 1 ounce clarified orange juice (see page 146)
    - 1 ounce Vanilla Lactic Syrup

    notes: In chapter 1, we delved (all too briefly) into the world of sparkling wines (see page 28). Because they can vary so widely in levels of acidity and sugar and display flavors that range from sharp to rich and yeasty notes, they often aren't interchangeable in cocktails. As with the Screwdriver (page 213), there's no comparing a Mimosa made with freshly pressed, in-season orange juice to one made with pasteurized juice. The former is bright and refreshing, while the latter often tastes flat. That said, oranges do vary in sweetness and acidity, so we include a bit of Citric Acid Solution to ensure that the drink has a bright, zippy flavor.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 ounce fresh orange juice

    notes: Although Bellinis are served year round in bars around the world, they're at their best when made with peaches at the peak of their ripeness-a privilege that few get to experience. Even the highest-quality commercial peach puree will taste dull in comparison to one made with peaches in their prime. Take note of when peaches are available at your local farmers' market, then seize the opportunity to make this classic cocktail. That said, the beauty of the Bellini is that it can be made with almost any fresh, ripe fruit, opening the door to numerous new creations.

    author: 
    notes: Another avenue for exploring Highball variations based on sparkling wines is to use fruit liqueur as a flavoring; just be careful not to add too much and oversweeten the drink. The classic Kir Royale strikes the right balance by using a restrained amount of crème de cassis, a black currant liqueur that retains the bright acidity of the fruit. That acidity makes it versatile for mixing, since it contributes both sweetness and sourness alongside its juicy fruit flavor. Although Champagne is traditional in this drink, Crémant de Bourgogne would also work well, and don't hesitate to venture farther afield, exploring the countless possibilities for pairing liqueurs with sparkling wines.
    ingredients: 
    - ½ ounce Gabriel Boudier Crème de Cassis de Dijon

While we stand by our belief that sparkling wine makes everything better, too much can overpower delicate flavors. This drink, made with Aperol, the lightest of aperitifs, is a case in point. If it were to call for more sparkling wine, that would push it into boozy territory, so it also includes seltzer to ensure that it's refreshing and fizzy enough, without overly interfering with the flavor profile.

The combination of bone-dry, salty manzanilla sherry, sweet and floral St-Germain, and juicy verjus could almost trick you into thinking you’re drinking a dry Muscat. Bitter Suze is added to curb the candy notes and the St-Germain and add an aperitif quality, while the sparkling cider brings body and funk—qualities not found in seltzer or sparkling wine.

    notes: You can also use still wine as the core of a drink. Because its proof is so much lower and the flavor more mild than a spirit, the amount of wine should be increased, with the amount of seltzer being decreased accordingly. Voilà! The classic Wine Spritz, which is indeed a type of Highball. Though wines vary widely in their sweetness and acidity, sticking with a small measure of seltzer as the mixer generally works well, as it will stretch and carry the distinctive flavors of the wine. We love a Wine Spritz with no trace of shame. What's not to like about a glass of chilled wine topped with seltzer? It's a drink fit for moms and cocktail nerds alike.

      Our favorite version of the Flip is one made with sherry because of the wine's nutty aroma and raisiny finish. Another popular variation is the classic Brandy Flip. For our ideal version of this drink, we first fine-tune the core, choosing the woodsy juiciness of Cognac, which works well with the fattiness of the egg. Then, although some recipes for this drink do call for a full 2 ounces of brandy, we think the brandy's higher proof calls for dialing back on the spirits a bit: too much alcohol in a Flip and it just tastes like creamy hooch. Finally, we increase the amount of sweetener slightly to compensate for the oloroso sherry's missing sweetness.

      According to Jerry Thomas's 1887 Bar-Tender's Guide, this cocktail's name has nothing to do with its flavor (where's the coffee, after all?), but rather its appearance: it looks like a cup of coffee. Lucky for us, cocktail naming has come a long way in the past 150 years. Regardless, the drink is a great example of how the Flip's core can be split between a fortified wine and a spirit, marrying both the root, sherry-based Flip and the Brandy Flip above. Here, tawny port brings both a great deal of flavor and sweetness requiring less syrup to balance-while the Cognac supports it with woodsy complexity.

    notes: One way to experiment with the balance in Flip-style drinks is to omit the egg and rely solely on the richness of cream. In fact, this style of cocktail is even more common and varied than egg-based drinks. Perhaps the most famous of these is the Alexander, which itself has many variations based on different core spirits. Our favorite is the classic Brandy Alexander, a mixture of brandy, crème de cacao, and heavy cream, where a rich liqueur serves as the sweetener. As in our take on the Brandy Flip (page 252), we favor a rich Cognac in this drink. Note that because the cocktail has a slightly higher alcohol content, it must be shaken a bit longer so it will be diluted enough to fill a standard coupe.

      Eggnog and other nogs have inspired a whole host of cocktails that incorporate both egg and cream.

The New York Flip is a more decadent articulation that replaces the lemon juice with heavy cream and an egg yolk: the same idea of a New York Sour expressed as a Flip with the bourbon and port as the connecting ingredients.

    notes: In this Flip variation, the cream isn't mixed into the cocktail; instead, it's whipped and floated on top. Because the heat of the underlying ingredients unravels the structure of the whipped cream, causing it to seep into the liquid in a less-than-appealing way, we recommend whipping the cream until it develops soft peaks so it will hold up longer.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces heavy cream
    - 1½ ounces Jameson Irish whiskey
    - ¾ ounce Demerara Gum Syrup 
    - 3 ounces hot brewed coffee
    steps:
    - Using a bowl and whisk, whip the cream until soft peaks begin to form
    - Warm a coffee or toddy mug by filling it with boiling water, letting it sit a minute or two, then dumping out the water
    - Pour in the whiskey and syrup, then slowly add the coffee while stirring continuously
    - Carefully spoon all the whipped cream on top of the drink

    notes: The Grasshopper is a rich but oddly refreshing liqueur-based cocktail. This cocktail and many others of its ilk have been relegated to dive bars for decades, but as high-quality liqueurs have come to the market made with actual mint and cacao rather than artificial flavorings, we've revisited these classics and added some of them to our repertoire. In this cocktail, the fresh mint garnish provides both aromatic and visual reinforcement of the minty character of the cocktail.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 ounce Tempus Fugit white crème de menthe
    - 1 ounce Giffard white crème de cacao
    - 1 ounce heavy cream
    - 8 mint leaves
    - "Garnish: 1 mint leaf"

    notes: Long before central heat could protect us against the elements, humans had the bright idea to mix dairy with some booze to ward off the cold and rain. In fact, that may be how the Flip originated, as a heated mixture of egg, ale, and sugar. Although modern-day Flips are almost always served cold, the idea of a warm drink on a cold day remains appealing, and one of the most comforting warm drinks out there is the Tom and Jerry, a wintertime favorite packed with rum, Cognac, dairy, and eggs (which are a component of the Tom and Jerry Batter).
    ingredients: 
    - 1 ounce El Dorado 12-year rum
    - 1 ounce Pierre Ferrand Ambre Cognac
    - 2 ounces Tom and Jerry Batter (page 296)
    - 2 ounces hot milk

    notes: Though the Piña Colada is a famous cocktail associated with sandy beaches and thatched bars, analyzing the recipe reveals that it's basically another type of Flip. It was a shock to us to think of the Piña Colada as something other than a sour-style drink, but there you have it. The rum brings proof, coconut cream adds fat and sweetness, and the pineapple juice provides sweetness and acidity.

      We know what you're thinking: A Mudslide? What is this, 1985? Sure, it's easy to make fun of this drink, as it's essentially a boozy milkshake. But then again, what's wrong with that? The Mudslide probably got its poor reputation because of how it's usually made: a near-equal mix of coffee liqueur, vodka, and Bailey's Irish cream. While that's okay, we prefer this version made with ice cream, a rich and flavorful addition that precludes the need to shake with ice, which can quickly water down the drink.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 ounce Aylesbury Duck vodka 
    - 1½ ounces Bailey's Irish Cream 
    - 1 ounce Kahlúa coffee liqueur 
    - 3 scoops vanilla or coffee ice cream
    - "Garnish: finely grated dark chocolate"

    notes: One of our favorite layered White Russian variations is the Hans Gruber, a cocktail that we created for a holiday-themed menu at the Walker Inn in 2015. In it, we've manipulated every component of the classic White Russian to create a sophisticated cocktail with the flavorful profile of pecan pie with ice cream. Though decadent, the toasted nuttiness of the pecan-infused rum and the implicit richness of the brown butter-infused brandy are balanced by the fig bomb of the Pedro Ximénez sherry. The maple-flavored whipped cream is one of our favorite revelations, with just a small amount of maple syrup flavoring the cream in a delicious way. We've also played with flavoring whipped cream with other ingredients, including orange curaçao and dry sherry. If you do the same, just be mindful of how much alcohol you add to the cream; anything more than around 2 ounce of alcohol per cup of cream will make the cream harder to whip.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces heavy cream
    - ¼ ounce dark, robust maple syrup
    - 1 ounce Toasted Pecan-Infused Plantation Rum
    - ¾ ounce Brown Butter-Infused Apple Brandy
    - 1 ounce Lustau San Emilio Pedro Ximénez sherry
    - 1 teaspoon Giffard Vanille de Madagascar
    - ¼ ounce Cane Sugar Syrup
    - 3 drops Salt Solution 
    - "Garnish: 1 spritz of Cruzan Black Strap rum"
    steps:
    - Using a bowl and whisk, whip the cream and maple syrup together just until soft peaks start to form
    - In a mixing glass, stir the remaining ingredients with ice
    - Strain into a chilled coupe
    - Carefully spoon the whipped cream on top, then mist the blackstrap rum over the drink

    notes: This Tom and Jerry-inspired cocktail demonstrates how the tang and creaminess of a few drops of Lactic Acid Solution can make a dramatic difference in a cocktail. The drink derives additional richness through two key ingredients—apple brandy infused with brown butter and creamy almond milk—with the amaretto providing some nuttiness. The result is an exceedingly smooth and rich drink.
    ingredients: 
    - 4¼ ounces Almond Milk
    - ¾ ounce Brown Butter-Infused Apple Brandy

      This cocktail, our tongue-in-cheek play on cereal milk, provides a great demonstration of how infusions and liqueurs can help bring the richness and sweetness of a classic Flip to a dairy-free concoction. Here, the cinnamon spice of Avuá Amburana cachaça is deepened by mixing it with a cacao nib tincture and a complex vanilla liqueur, all built on the backbone of homemade almond milk. In a twist, this cocktail isn't meant to be sipped (though you're more than welcome to): instead, pour it over cereal for a buzzy breakfast.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 ounce Avuá Amburana cachaça 
    - ½ ounce Cacao Nib Tincture
    - ¼ ounce Giffard Vanille de Madagascar
    - ¾ ounce Demerara Gum Syrup
    - 4 ounces Almond Milk
    - Cereal
    steps:
    - Combine all the ingredients (except the cereal) in a mixing glass and stir to mix well
    - Pour over cereal in a bowl and serve with a spoon Be sure to lap up any remaining liquid!

    notes: The Campfire Flip is a smoky riff on a classic Flip. We start with a smoked ingredient, Hickory-Smoked Cognac, which we pair with sherry and a bit of vanilla liqueur. The result is a rich drink with a smoked-woody complexity that plays off the barrel-aged flavors already present in both the Cognac and the sherry.

    - 1 ounce Hickory Smoke-Infused Cognac (page 290)
    - 1 ounce Lustau Los Arcos Amontillado Sherry

    author: Alex Day
    year: 2017
    notes: Smoky flavors need not be introduced via smoke itself; they can also be added by including ingredients that have smoky flavors conferred by cooking, such as grilling. One of our favorite ways of working with this in cocktails is to use a syrup made with grilled pineapple, as in this smoky variation on the Piña Colada. Substituting our Grilled Pineapple Syrup for some of the fresh pineapple juice takes this rich tropical drink in a slightly savory direction.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces Caña Brava white rum
    - ½ ounce Cruzan Black Strap rum
