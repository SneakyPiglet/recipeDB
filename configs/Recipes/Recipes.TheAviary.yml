      "This drink has never actually appeared on our menu: the labor involved in producing the number of spheres necessary for a full night of service is prohibitively high for us. This isn't to say this cocktail isn't delicious, however. And in situations where scale becomes less of an issue (such as in a home kitchen), this recipe becomes much more reasonable to make."

  - name: Edison Square
    notes: |+2
      This drink is derived, both in name and content, from a traditional Vieux Carré (a French phrase for “Old Square”). We began with an intensely aromatic caramel tea, and replaced the herbal notes classically provided by Bénédictine and vermouth with notes of chocolate, pistachio, and ancho chile.
    glassware: novel
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2oz caramel pu-erh tea syrup
    - 1/4oz Dumante Verdenoce Pistachio Liqueur
    - 1/2oz BroVo Chocolate Liqueur
    - 1/4oz Ancho Reyes Ancho Chile Liqueur
    - 3/4oz Jean-Luc Pasquet Coeur de Grande Champagne Cognac
    - 3/4oz Rittenhouse Bottled in Bond Rye Whiskey
    - 1/4oz demerara syrup
    - 1/2oz Fusion Verjus Rouge
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients in a small vacuum bag and seal on the highest setting. 
    - Heat en sous vide at 80°C (175°F) for 5 minutes, or until contents are thoroughly warmed. 
    - Reserve warm.
    - Insert a small funnel into the mouth of the glass bulb service piece, and pour in the contents of a single edison square bag. 
    - Carefully drop 2-3 small pieces (approximately 7g) of dry ice into the bulb. 
    - At the table, gently tilt the bulb sideways to allow aromatic vapor to flow onto the table. 
    - When vapor has completely dissipated, add metal straw to the bulb and offer to guest. 
    - To eliminate risk of ingestion of dry ice, do not pour or consume drink while vapor is still bubbling.

      Here we highlight the various flavors that can go into a classic Hurricane. By simply observing the differences in the ingredients' densities, we find that - with a bit of care and patience - they can be layered.
    glassware: hurricane
    ingredients:
    - 1.75oz cranberry stock
    - 1oz passionfruit stock
    - 1oz navel orange juice
    - 1/2oz lime juice
    - 3/4oz Dos Maderas 5+3 Aged Rum
    - 3/4oz Banks 5-Island Rum
    - 3/4oz Smith & Cross Jamaican rum
    - Paper cocktail umbrella
    steps:
    - "Using cocktail layering device, layer ingredients into tall, slender carafe in the following order: cranberry stock, passionfruit stock, navel orange juice, lime juice, Dos Maderas 5+3 Aged Rum, Banks 5-Island Rum, and Smith & Cross Jamaican rum, allowing each layer to settle and stabilize before adding the next. Serve alongside a glass of crushed ice with a straw. Garnish with a paper cocktail umbrella."
    - Layering this cocktail can be temperamental; you can increase your chances of success by ensuring all ingredients are thoroughly chilled to the same temperature before attempting to build it.

      "This cocktail - one of the more straightforward ones we include - is designed to showcase one of our favorite tequilas. We use a light hand with technique to let this product shine, but the use of Fresno chili ice adds an extra dimension of interest. Because the ice consists mostly of water, it melts more slowly than other flavored ices found in this book. This allows a guest a bit of control: the slower the cocktail is consumed, the spicier it gets."

      The original Jungle Bird is thought to have originated at Aviary Bar in Kuala Lumpur in the late 1970s. It seemed only fitting that we develop our own version of this classic tiki drink.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 4.5oz jungle bird base
    - reserved Gosling's spheres
    - 1oz Campari, chilled thoroughly in freezer
    - 2oz rum water, chilled thoroughly in freezer
    - 1oz Gosling's Black Seal Rum, chilled thoroughly in freezer
    steps:
    - Carefully pour jungle bird base into tall, slender glass, taking care not to splash liquid on sides of glass. Using a perforated spoon, gently add a large spoonful (approximately 40g) Gosling's spheres to glass. Using a cocktail layering device, layer campari, rum water, and Gosling's rum into glass, allowing each layer to settle and stabilize before adding the next. Serve with glass straw.
    - We add enough Gosling's spheres to create a layer that's two spheres thick.
    - Rinsing the cocktail layering device between layers ensures colors won't bleed and encourages more crisp divisions between layers.

      The Fernet con Coca - widely heralded as the national drink of Argentina - is so popular there that Italian producer Fratelli Branca built a second Fernet distillery in Buenos Aires to address demand for the bitter liqueur. Interestingly, the Argentine formulation of the product is drier than its international counterpart, a subtle acknowledgement of the way it's generally consumed. Our riff - inspired by the 2016 Tour of South America menu at Next - adds a bit of depth and complexity to the traditional foundation of this drink.
    glassware: novel
    ingredients:
    - 6oz Coca-Cola
    - 1 1/2oz Croft Fine Ruby Port
    - 1/2oz Fernet-Branca Liqueur
    - 1/2oz cinnamon syrup
    - 1/4oz Luxardo Amaro Abano

Carbonate according to manufacturer's instructions. Fill a small soda bottle with the cocktail. Cap with bottle capper. Reserve in the refrigerator.

      Inspired by the sound of shuffling poker chips and a desire to further challenge and grow our ice program, we asked Martin Kastner at Crucial Detail if he could develop a custom ice mold for this drink. The mildness of the horchata offers an accepting canvas for the myriad flavors released by the fast-melting ice chips.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 4oz Marcona rice milk
    - 1/2oz simple syrup
    - 1/2oz High West Western Oat Silver Whiskey
    - 1/2oz Rhine Hall Peach Brandy
    - 1/2oz Lazzaroni Amaretto Liqueur
    - 20 drops salt solution
    - 1 nutmeg
    - 1 nutmeg ice chip
    - 1 allspice ice chip
    - 2 black cardamom ice chips
    - 2 Angostura cinnamon ice chips
    - 3 white peach ice chips
    - 3 white peach cinnamon ice chips
    steps:
    - Combine the rice milk, simple syrup, whiskey, brandy, amaretto, and salt solution in a cocktail mixing glass, stirring to mix thoroughly. Reserve in refrigerator to chill thoroughly.
    - Any peach eau de vie may be reasonably substituted here. We note this because, depending on location, some products marketed as “brandy” may include sugar, which would unbalance this cocktail.
    - Using Microplane, grate small dusting of nutmeg into medium glass. Thread ice chips onto metal spoon straw, and lay horizontally across the lip of the glass. Serve glass with a carafe of the cocktail. At the table, invite the guest to pull straw from ice chips, allowing them to fall into glass. Pour contents of carafe over ice chips. Stir may be used to stir the drink and to break up chips to taste them individually.

    - 20g Bittermens Boston Bittahs (serves 6)
    - 9.5g The Bitter End Moroccan Bitters (serves 6)
    - 2 1/2oz loaded to the gunwalls base
    - 1oz cold water
    - 3/4oz pineapple juice, extracted with juicer
    - 1/2oz lime juice
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients with ice in a cocktail shaker. Shake vigorously until chilled and diluted, then strain into the glass ship in a bottle.
    - The unusual addition of a notable amount of water to the final assembly of this cocktail is necessary to bring it into balance. Without the water, the cocktail is overly rich.
    - Present the guest with a small lit candlestick in holder, cocktail in bottle, and ceramic cup, positioning the bottle between candle and guest so that the bottle is illuminated by candle. Spray mace texture through candle flame into ceramic cup. Pour contents of glass bottle inco ceramic cup. Extinguish flame.
    - After spraying the mace tincture into the ceramic cup, we offer the cup to guests and invite them to smell it before pouring the cocktail into it. We also leave the extinguished, smoldering candle on the table for a minute or two before removing it. These aromas add to the overall experience of this cocktail.

    notes: |+2
      The origin of this drink stems from our interest in making a blue cocktail using only naturally-occurring colors. In this case, we infuse tequila and mezcal with a deep blue pigment found in butterfly pea flowers. This pigment, we discovered, dramatically changes color (from deep blue to a light magenta) with the addition of acid. We wanted to share the excitement of seeing this color transformation with our guests, so we devised a way to temporarily sequester the blue tequila from an acidic cordial until the guest “stirs” the drink together. Serves 6.
    glassware: novel
    ingredients:
    - 400g Tequila Cabeza
    - 100g Del Maguey VIDA Mezcal
    - 1.5g dried blue butterfly pea flowers
    - 1oz finger lime coconut cordial
    - 1/2oz lime juice
    - 1 1/2oz Bring Another Smurf! Base
    - Maldon sea salt
    - 1 chewy coconut rock
    - Coconut cream pudding
    - Micro cilantro leaf
    - Cluster of finger lime cells
    - Fresno pudding
    - Liquid nitrogen
    steps:
    - Using a propane torch, toast one piece of chewy coconut rock on all sides until edges are slightly burnt. Allow the coconut rock to cool completely. Squeeze a small dot of coconut pudding onto the cleaned coconut shell fragment. Place the coconut rock onto the pudding dot. Squeeze a large dollop of coconut cream pudding on top of the rock. Garnish with one micro cilantro leaf, one cluster of finger lime cells, three small dots of Fresno pudding, and a few flakes of sea salt.
    - Combine finger lime coconut cordial and lime juice with ice in a cocktail shaker. Shake vigorously until chilled and diluted, then strain into port pipe glass. Carefully add a small amount of liquid nitrogen to the glass. Allow the surface of the liquid to freeze for about 10 seconds. Pour off any excess liquid nitrogen. Pour the smurf base onto the frozen surface of cordial. Mist with one spray of toasted coconut tincture. Place coconut bite over the mouth of the glass.
    - We make a point of keeping the gate of our Hawthorne strainer open while straining to include some residual ice shards in the cocktail. The shards float to the top of the cocktail, where they encourage the surface to freeze more easily when we add the liquid nitrogen.
    - Invite the guest to blow gently into the port pipe; bubbles will cause the ice disk separating the layers to spin and stir the drink.
    - We ask the guest to keep the mouth of this glass covered with the coconut shell as they blow bubbles through the pipe; this helps prevent overager bubble-blowers from splashing themselves in the face with frozen cocktail.

      We use a combination of whole and skim milks here (rather than all whole milk) to offset the fat and viscosity provided by the macadamia nuts. The result is a texture we find pleasingly thick but not too heavy.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 140g toasted macadamia nuts
    - 500g whole milk
    - 200g skim milk
    - 100g Flor de Caña 4 Year Extra Seco White Rum
    - 26g Giffard White Crème de Cacao
    - 38g sugar
    - 2.6g kosher salt
    - 0.5g guar gum
    - Macadamia powder
    steps:
    - Place toasted macadamia nuts in the food processor to chop coarsely. Combine macadamia nuts, whole milk, and skim milk in a vacuum bag and seal on the highest setting. Cook en sous vide at 65°C (150°F) for 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare an ice bath. Chill bag in the ice bath until completely cool. Strain through chinois. Transfer mixture to blender. Add rum and crème de cacao. With the blender running at low speed, add sugar, salt, and guar gum and blend until mixture emulsifies. Strain through chinois, then through 100-micron superbag. Transfer to a glass bottle. Reserve in the refrigerator to chill thoroughly.

    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2oz North Shore Distillery Aquavit

      We drew inspiration for this cocktail by asking ourselves, “Can we make a drink with the vegetal, herbal qualities of a Bloody Mary, but with something other than tomato?” The result is this drink that offers a savory, rustic, freshly-foraged vibe.
    glassware: mason jar
    ingredients:
    - 50g olive oil
    - 2oz carrot juice, extracted with juicer
    - 1 1/2oz Rhum J.M. 100 Proof Agricole Blanc
    - 3/4oz lemon juice
    - 3/4oz spiced syrup
    - 5 dashes Tabasco sauce
    - kosher salt
    - ground black pepper
    steps:
    - Pour olive oil into mister. Mist 1 herb bouquet with oil. Sprinkle herb spice mix over bouquet.
    - Fill a small Mason jar 3/4 full of ice. Combine carrot juice, rum, lemon juice, spiced syrup, and Tabasco with ice in a cocktail shaker. Shake vigorously until chilled and diluted, then double-strain into an ice-filled Mason jar. Fit Mason jar with wide-mesh lid insert. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper onto the pickled quail egg. Gently spoon the quail egg onto the mesh lid. Insert herb bouquet into the mesh. Serve with a metal straw.
    - The lid inserts we use are often referred to as “flower lids” or “frog lids”; they're typically used for building flower arrangements in Mason jars.

      The addition of rye to the red wine changes its alcohol density, which allows us to layer it more crisply and easily.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 3/4oz Saintsbury Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir
    - 1 1/4oz Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye Whiskey
    - 1oz tonka pear syrup
    - 1/2oz lemon juice
    - 3/4oz egg white
    - Fall spice ice
    steps:
    - In a small glass, combine the pinot noir and 1/4oz rye, stirring to mix thoroughly. Set aside.
    - Place one fall spice ice cylinder into a tall glass. Combine the remaining ingredients in a cocktail shaker. Dry shake until frothy. Add ice and shake again vigorously until chilled and diluted, then strain into the glass over the fall spice ice cylinder. Let the drink rest for at least one minute to allow the egg white to settle. Gently pour in the red wine.

      The 20th Century Limited was an express passenger train that ran between Chicago and New York from 1902 through 1967, and served as the namesake for a popular cocktail during this area consisting of gin, vermouth, and crème de cacao. Nearly a century later, we wanted to try our hand at a slightly modernized version of this cocktail.

      We frequently find inspiration in single ingredients or products. This drink was born from a tasting of BarSol Perfecto Amor, which featured an intense, ripe cantaloupe flavor. Other flavors amplify and complement the idea of a melon ripening over time. While we suggest that three minutes is a good minimum amount of time to allow this cocktail to steep, allowing the cocktail to infuse longer further intensifies its flavor. When serving this drink at The Aviary, we present the guest with the press pot and a small sand timer, which we invert at the table. We keep a separate timer running at the bar, so our staff knows when to return to the table to depress the plunger and strain the drink for the guest.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2oz The Scarlet Ibis Trinidad Rum
    - 1oz BarSol Perfecto Amor
    - 1/2oz Petite Canne Martinique Sugar Cane Syrup
    - 1 pinch kosher salt
    - 8 cilantro leaves
    - peel from 1/2 orange, removed in one continuous spiral strip
    - 0.3g curry powder
    - 4g whole French curry (vadouvan)
    - 3 air-dried makrut lime leaves
    - single portion, or 3oz batch
    - 1 3/4oz cantaloupe juice, extracted with juicer
    - 3/4oz lemon juice
    steps:
    - In a French press pot, arrange cilantro leaves, orange peel, hot curry, French curry, and makrut leaves.
    - Combine the Scarlet Ibis Trinidad Rum, BarSol Perfetor Amor, Petite Canne Martinique Sugar Cane Syrup, kosher salt, cantaloupe juice, and lemon juice with ice in a cocktail shaker. 
    - Shake briefly until chilled and diluted, then strain into the press pot. 
    - Allow the mixture to steep for at least three minutes. 
    - To serve, depress the plunger and pour the drink into a glass.

      The classic Cobbler - a mixture of spirit, sweetener, and fruit - is thought to be the first cocktail served with a straw (made necessary by the crushed ice, or “cobbles,” on which the drink is served). We use the crushed ice as an opportunity to add flavors of sherry, black pepper, and melon to a cocktail base of citrus and strawberry. Serves 6.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 273g strawberries
    - 4g orange peel
    - 4g lemon peel, removed with peeler, all pith removed
    - 10g sugar

    - 200g Emilio Hidalgo Fino Sherry
    - 150g water
    - 1 lemon peel, removed with peeler
    - micro pearl ice portions
    steps:
    - Freeze strawberries in a covered container overnight. Remove from the freezer and lightly crush with a muddler or rolling pin. Reserve in the refrigerator.
    - To make cobbler liquid, combine orange peel, lemon peel, and sugar in a medium bowl. Muddle mixture with a cocktail muddler. Allow to sit for 20 minutes.
    - Meanwhile, combine simple syrup and glucose in a small saucepan. Warm over medium heat, stirring to dissolve glucose. Remove from heat.
    - In a large bowl, combine the syrup mixture, crushed strawberries, and citrus peel mixture with remaining ingredients, stirring to completely dissolve sugars and acids. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. Strain through chinois. Transfer to a glass bottle and reserve in the refrigerator.
    - Combine the Strawberry Cobbler base, sherry, and water in a medium bowl, stirring to mix thoroughly. Strain into a glass bottle. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill thoroughly.
    - Pour 125g cawberry batch into a small carafe. Express lemon peel over carafe. Discard peel.
    - Place 1 micro pearl ice portion into a medium glass. Insert a bombilla straw into the glass. At the table, pour the contents of the carafe over the ice pearls.

      Sometimes our inspiration comes from an interesting service piece; such was the case when we found these vessels that reminded us of a cartoon bomb. While playing around with them, we discovered they could comfortably hold dry ice, spouting dramatic clouds that we reasoned might be great for dispersing an aroma. We began sniffing the contents of our pantry, combining the most aromatic ingredients we could find until we had something that smelled and tasted great.
    glassware: mug
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2oz Zaya Gran Reserva rum
    - 1 1/2oz Fusion Verjus Rouge
    - 1oz gingerbread syrup
    - 1/2oz Bénédictine
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients in a small vacuum bag and seal on the highest setting. Heat en sous vide at 80°C (175°F) for 5 minutes, or until contents are thoroughly warmed. Reserve warm.
    - Insert a small funnel into the mouth of a glass bulb service piece, and pour in the contents of single tea in trinidad bag. Carefully drop 2-3 small pieces (approximately 7g) of dry ice into the bulb. At table, gently tilt bulb sideways to allow aromatic vapor to flow onto the table. When the vapor has completely dissipated, add a metal straw to the bulb and offer it to the guest.
    - To eliminate risk of ingestion of dry ice, do not pour or consume drink while vapor is still bubbling.

  - name: Branding Iron
    notes: |+2
      The unlikely origin of this drink came from a discussion amongst several of our bartenders about replacing the black felt coasters we use with something more rustic. We found some interesting pine branch cross-sections that we felt might work well for this. At the same time, we were exploring the use of a branding iron on citrus peels. We wondered about using the iron to brand our logo into our pine branch coasters; when we tried this, we noticed the smoke from the coaster smelled quite aromatic and delicious. We pair the pine smoke with St. George's Terroir Gin, which is made with pine boughs from the mountains near the distillery.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1/2oz St. George Terroir Gin
    - 3/4oz Rhine Hall Oak Aged Apple Brandy
    - 1/2oz St. George NOLA Coffee Liqueur
    - 1/4oz St. George Pear Brandy
    - 1/2oz Fusion Verjus Blanc
    - 1oz Lustau Don Nuño Oloroso Sherry
    - 1/4oz St. George Bruto Americano
    - 1/2oz Rhine Hall Apple Brandy
    - 1/4oz demerara syrup
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients with ice in a cocktail mixing glass. Stir until chilled and diluted, then strain into a small carafe. Reserve in the refrigerator.
    - Using a propane torch, heat branding iron in a forge. At table, carefully brand the Douglas fir branch coaster with branding iron. Extinguish any flames, and invert a medium glass onto a coaster to capture smoke. Lift the glass from the coaster to release smoke, then pour contents of carafe into the glass.

      Questioning the purpose of a cocktail garnish leads us to try expanding the role this accoutrement can play in a drink. Here, a rosemary garnish adds visual appeal while also contributing a significant flavor impact to the drink itself. The unique service piece used to suspend the garnish in the glass was designed for us by Martin Kastner.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2oz Jean-Luc Pasquet Coeur de Grande Champagne Cognac
    - 3/4oz graham cracker syrup
    - 1/2oz Bonal Gentiane-Quina
    - 1/4oz Bénédictine
    - 2 dashes Angostura Aromatic Bitters
    - 3/4oz lemon juice
    - 2 cider ice cubes
    - 1 small sprig rosemary
    - 1/2oz Laird's Straight Apple Brandy, warmed to 50°C (120°F)
    steps:
    - Combine the first five  ingredients in a medium bowl, stirring to mix thoroughly. Transfer to a small carafe. Reserve in the refrigerator to chill thoroughly.
    - Combine cocktail portion, lemon juice, and cider ice cubes in a cocktail shaker. Shake vigorously until the ice is completely melted. Transfer the chilled cocktail to a small carafe.
    - Suspend rosemary sprig upside-down in a clip service piece, and clip onto the side of a medium glass. Pour warm apple brandy into the glass.
    - At the table, carefully use a candle lighter to ignite apple brandy. Allow it to burn until the rosemary is toasted and fragrant. Pour the contents of the carafe into the glass to extinguish the flame.

      We base this drink on a very special barrel of reposado tequila we procured from Casa Noble. When working with limited, small quantities of rare or special spirits, we generally try to enhance the base spirit's flavor in subtle ways rather than overpowering it or losing it in a more complex build. We pair this cocktail with an aroma of cigar and cedar, the latter of which adds length and complexity to the smoke.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 2oz Casa Noble Reposado Tequila

    - 1/4oz Distillerie de Biercée Noir d'Ivoire Liqueur
    - 2 dashes The Bitter Truth Chocolate Bitters
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients with ice in a cocktail mixing glass. Stir until chilled and diluted, then strain into a medium glass. Reserve in the refrigerator.
    - Place the cocktail into a cigar humidor. Load smoking gun with tobacco cedar mixture. Lightly smoke the cocktail and humidor. Serve immediately.

      When we first opened The Aviary, we felt that inclusion of a Bloody Mary was compulsory. We'd just begun learning about flavored ices, and our idea was to try refactoring the flavors usually used as garnishes into interesting ice for the drink. When we opened our second Aviary location in New York in 2017, we felt it was only fitting to revisit this drink for our inaugural menu there. Maturity and the benefit of hindsight led us to reconsider and rebalance much of the drink into something we feel is more refined. We present both versions here to highlight the iterative process many of our drinks undergo over their lifespans. Serves 6.

      The bourbon used as the base of this cocktail is one we crafted in collaboration with Maker's Mark. We present it in a service piece that was custom-designed for us by Martin Kastner. The “cloche,” as it's called, helps constrain the aroma of this cocktail to avoid potentially contaminating the experience of nearby guests who may be drinking something different. Maker's 46 may be used as a substitute bourbon in this recipe.
    glassware: novel
    ingredients:
    - 2oz Maker's Mark Private Select Aviary Barrel Bourbon
    - 1 1/4oz mocha chai tea stock
    - 3/4oz Cocchi Storico Vermouth di Torino
    - 1/2oz Tempus Fugit Spirits Crème de Cacao a la Vanilla
    - 1/2oz Amaro Averna
    - 1/4oz Giffard Banane du Brésil
    - 1 drop cinnamon extract
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients in a cocktail mixing glass, stirring to mix. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill thoroughly.
    - Pour cocktail into bottom chamber of cloche service piece. Cover with a cloche top.
    - Using a long, slender skewer, poke a small hole in the bottom of each cinnamon puff. Carefully rotate the skewer tool to create a cavity that is as large as possible without breaking through the sides of the puff. Fill the cavity of the puff with ganache. Press one small cube of mocha chai candy into the ganache. Cover the hole with the graham cracker streusel.
    - Place 1 spoonful of cloche aroma mixture in the chamber of a Volcano vaporizer. Attach a length of heatproof silicone hose to the nozzle of the vaporizer. Place the top of the hose into the cloche and fill with the aroma, placing cinnamon puff over the cloche opening to contain the aroma. Serve with a metal straw.

      This drink was originally inspired by an affogato (coffee and vanilla ice cream). The carbonated milk punch replicates the role of the ice cream, with its creamy mouthfeel and vanilla notes. The coffee shares geographic roots with the herbaceous, earthy flavors it's combined with, exemplifying the general culinary tendency that “things that grow together go together.”

    notes: |+2
      The classic Michelada, one of our favorite hangover soothers, is an unfussy combination of cold light beer, lime, salt, and a dash of hot sauce. An early version of our take on this drink - which we served at The Aviary in Chicago - was served in a pint glass with a spice rim. We used our opening of another Aviary in New York as an opportunity to revisit and refine this cocktail, adding a few bites of food to pair with it as well. We present both variations here. This constant iteration on ideas is common for us; it's rare that any given recipe becomes set in stone.
    glassware: pint glass
    ingredients:
    - 1oz Micahlada base
    - 1oz Suntory Toki Whisky, chilled thoroughly in freezer
    - 126g Evil Twin Bushido
    - 1 lime wedge
    steps:
    - Wipe outside of pint glass with lime wedge. Holding glass with rim facing slightly downwards, sprinkle Micah spice onto the outer rim of the glass. Discard the lime. Pour Micahlada base and whisky into the glass, stirring to combine. Fill the glass three-quarters full of ice cubes. Gently pour beer over ice to fill the glass.

      This drink is anchored squarely in our culinary roots at Alinea, where questions like, “What if we made an edible cocktail that's eaten with a spoon?” are not unusual. We drew our original inspiration from a seminal dish of carrot-flavored foam created by the inimitable chefs at elBulli, starting with a similar foam made of beer. We then crafted a list of flavors that we felt would complement our beer foam - a process we refer to as “flavor bouncing.”

    - finger lime cells
    - beer foam
    steps:
    - Remove chamomile gel bowls from the refrigerator. Using a demitasse spoon, shape a quenelle of Chartreuse sorbet and place on top of gel. Squeeze 6 pea-sized dots of sage pudding around gel. Arrange 6 compressed pear cubes into a bowl. Randomly scatter sage leaves around garnishes. Sprinkle a small spoonful of blood orange cells over the gel. Place two small clusters of finger lime cells into the bowl. Using an immersion blender, froth the beer base (some liquid will remain). Spoon a large mound of beer froth over the gel and garnishes. Cover the dish with a few pinches of fresh chamomile petals.

    notes: |+2
      While attending a prominent cocktail industry event in New Orleans, we had the opportunity to taste a rum that reminded us of carrot cake. Inspired by this, we wanted to riff on one of New Orleans' most popular classic cocktails - the Ramos Gin Fizz - and develop a drink with similar characteristics while highlighting that carrot cake flavor. This recipe took us nearly two years to develop and perfect.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 2oz carrot cake rum
    - 2oz carrot rooibos syrup
    - 1oz acidulated carrot juice
    - 1oz cream cheese milk
    - 3/4oz egg white
    - 60g ice
    - 1oz carrot top soda
    steps:
    - Combine carrot cake rum, carrot juice, carrot rooibos syrup, cream cheese milk, and egg white in a cocktail shaker. Dry shake until frothy. Add ice and shake again vigorously until ice is completely melted. Fill a tall glass three-quarters full with the shaken cocktail. Spritz with orange blossom walnut tincture. Allow mixture to stabilize for 3 minutes. Add the remaining shaken cocktail. Gently add carrot top soda until foam rises above the lip of the glass. Garnish with black walnut crumbs.
    - Shaking the ice until it completely melts creates very fine bubbles, with a texture similar to that of whipped cream. The melted ice ends up adding about 2oz dilution to this drink.

      The smoke from a used bourbon barrel stave is uniquely aromatic. We pair its sweetness here with apple brandy and Cognac, while complementing the smoke's bitter notes with several different amari and apéritifs.

#Dusty Bottles
  - name: "Dusty Bottle: Vesper"
    notes: |+2
      In addition to crafting delicious martinis, Dukes Bar - situated in London's Dukes Hotel - historically served as the local watering hole for Sir Ian Fleming during his time writing the James Bond novels. The bar is said to have been the birthplace of the Vesper martini, a cocktail infamously introduced by Bond in Casino Royale. Shaking a martini (as Bond regularly requests) serves to aggressively chill it, which flouted contention at the time, but dampens the flavors of the spirits being used. With all due respect to 007, we've altered his original proportions a bit and prefer to stir this drink to allow the character of the vintage spirits to shine through.
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 1oz Beefeater London Dry gin - 1970s gallon
    - 1oz Smirnoff Vodka - 1970s gallon
    - 1/2oz Lillet Blanc - 1970s
    - 1 lemon
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients with ice in a cocktail mixing glass. Stir vigorously until chilled and diluted, then strain into a small glass. Using a channel knife, trim a long, continuous peel of lemon in the direction of the equator. Wrap peel around a straw to shape into a voil. Holding each end of the coil between thumbs and forefingers, pull coil taut over the cocktail to express oils. Reform coil and use to garnish the rim of the cocktail.

      Irish brothers Edward and John Burke were distillers and importers in New York City during the turn of the twentieth century. In 1943, they imported the case of Jamaican rum we make use of in this cocktail. The rum has an earthy funkiness, offering notes of canned artichokes and green olive that lend themselves to an unusual and delicious daiquiri.

    ingredients:
    - 2oz E&J Burke Jamaican Rum - 1943

    notes: |+2
      The modern-day White Negroni is typically bracingly bitter and earthy. Up until a few decades ago, however, a different variant of this classic cocktail could be made using a raspberry-flavored liqueur produced by Campari. The cordial contributed to a drink that was rich, sweet, and deliciously smooth.

      "Something we notice about vintage gins is that they tend to be remarkably stable; the botanicals and other flavors take on interesting mature qualities, but overall the spirit still tastes recognizably gin-like. Vermouth, on the other hand, dramatically changes as it ages: the color deepens and flavors turn nutty as they oxidize, not dissimilar from those found in aged sherries."

    notes: |+2
      The first known recorded recipe for the Brooklyn seems to come in 1914 by way of David Straub, who tended bar at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The cocktail made use of Amer Picon, a bittersweet herbal liqueur that has undergone several reformulations since the 1970s, which have left it bearing little resemblance to its original self. Our discovery of a bottle of this liqueur in its original formulation  inspired us to gather the other contemporary ingredients for an early-century version of this cocktail.

      The S.P. Lancaster Distillery was a small distillery located near Bardstown, Kentucky. In addition to bourbon, the distillery also produced what would become the base for a line of bitters produced by the New York-based Fee Brothers. The distillery was ultimately forced to close during the Prohibition era. A batch of bourbon distilled by S.P. Lancaster in the spring of 1916 sat aging in barrels until it was  discovered, bottles, and sold in 1932 as “medicinal whiskey” by the American Medicinal Spirits Company.
