#The Golden Era
  - name: Jet Pilot
    notes: With the growth of aviation and the space race, tiki bars went from serving Test Pilots to Jet Pilots to Space Pilots to celebrate their daring feats.

This is basically a reproportioned and tweaked Zombie, but a little roll, pitch, and yaw make this an interesting variation.

  - name: Tiki Bowl
    notes: A Kon-Tiki original, but still very closely related to any number of drinks in Donn’s style. Donn’s signature “secret weapon” was a combination of honey, Angostura bitters, and Pernod, which features in many of his cocktails. The “diaspora” of  Donn-style exotic cocktails was spread both by his acolytes and imitators to venues around the world. Serves 2.

    author: Pat O'Briens
    notes: A perfect three-ingredient drink that captures exotic flavor in the simplest way. Even though Pat O’Brien’s is an Irish-themed bar, this drink became a tiki bar staple around the world. Much like the Mai Tai, the Hurricane you will be served today is often bright red, a far cry from the original.

#Creating the Space
  - name: Pampanito
    author: Martin Cate
    notes: Load yer ballast tank and explore the depths! The Pampanito was inspired by a visit to Jamaica and her distilleries. When I spoke with Joy Spence, master blender of Appleton Rum, she said that they loved to take the wet sugar, a rich molasses stew from which the sugar has not been extracted, and use it to make lemonade. “Of course,” she added, “we usually put a little rum in there, too.” So I used that as my starting point, and added some traditional Jamaican flavors like allspice, and then lengthened it with soda so it wasn’t so heavy. It gets its name from the USS Pampanito submarine docked in San Francisco, although the story of how that came to be is convoluted and not interesting in the slightest.

    author: Martin Cate
    notes: "Inspired by swizzles of yore, The Twenty Seventy Swizzle came about one night while sitting at the bar with old pal and future Master of the Cove Ron Roumas. I proposed to him that I was going to make the ultimate swizzle based on several classic swizzle recipes. We made several versions and discussed what we liked and disliked about each before settling on a final recipe that incorporated the best of all worlds. The name was inspired by the two rums that I thought really made this drink sing: the heady vanilla of Angostura 1919 and mighty Lemon Hart 151."

    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice

    notes: The journeys of Donn Beach inspired this cocktail. From Donn’s roots in New Orleans, we start with bourbon. As his travels took him to the Caribbean, we add the rum and spices. And as he sets up shop in Southern California, we add the fresh citrus and honey. At the Mai Kai in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, ex–Don the Beachcomber’s bartender Mariano Licudine invented one of his most famous drinks, The Black Magic, which uses coffee and citrus. Inspired by The Black Magic, we add Bittermens New Orleans Coffee liqueur, which brings us full circle to Donn’s original home.

    notes: To be a sailor in the British Royal Navy in the 1700s was not what anyone would call a life of leisure, but at least there was the daily rum ration to look forward to, even if it was diluted with brackish water. In 1740, Admiral Edward “Old Grogram” Vernon told his sailors they could exchange their salt and bread for limes and sugar and, not being fools, they perhaps became the first to see the wisdom in forsaking food for a good cocktail. And so Grog was born.

Maybe not.) If you’re looking for a nineteenth-century–style grog, try a black blended rum. For a more refined grog, as we serve at Smuggler’s Cove, choose a blended aged rum."

As cocktail historian David Wondrich says, “[Bombo] is a simple drink in the same way a tripod is a simple device: Remove one leg and it cannot stand, set it up properly and it will hold the whole weight of the world.” Ours is a kind of proto-old-fashioned, made with Demerara Syrup for a more refined molasses flavor."

However, for a closer historical approximation of colonial-era drinks, you may wish to choose a pot still unaged rum or pot still lightly aged rum.

    notes: Created to honor Mary Pickford, the legendary actress and founder of United Artists, while she was shooting a film in Cuba, this cocktail was a staple of Cuban bars and nightclubs serving thirsty Americans. The Smuggler’s Cove house style for the Prohibition-era cocktails is to use a blended lightly aged rum for more body and to mimic the less- efficient distillation methods of the day. Alternatively, you may wish to use a column still lightly aged rum, but we suggest using one with a slightly higher proof to maintain an era-appropriate “pop.”

    notes: The beautiful and traditional way to enjoy a Martinique rhum agricole is like this, with just a hint of lime and Martinique cane sugar. In Martinique, you are frequently given all of the ingredients to make the drink yourself, including a full bottle of rhum. (Since they only give you one slice of lime, there’s no chance you’ll tear through the whole bottle. Also, they assume you’re a decent person.) This tradition is referred to with the phrase, “chacun prépare sa propre mort” which, roughly translated, means “each prepares his own death.”
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 teaspoon Martinique sugarcane syrup
    - 2 ounces cane AOC Martinique rhum agricole blanc (substitute an élevé sous bois, or rhum vieux  for a Ti’ Punch Vieux)

    steps:
    - In an old-fashioned glass, add the sugarcane syrup and rhum. 
    - Swizzle with a barspoon or lélé. 
    - Squeeze the lime round over the drink and drop it into the glass. (The squeeze should yield 6 to 10 drops of lime  juice.)

    notes: Named after the green oasis in the heart of Trinidad’s Port of Spain, Trader Vic described this drink, created at the Queen’s Park Hotel, as “the most delightful form of anesthesia given out today.” Rum was not produced on a large scale in Trinidad until after World War II, so despite the drink’s Trinidad origins, we suggest a black blended rum, the likely choice when the drink was created. We also believe that even though the bitters look pretty when floated on top, the drink tastes much better when they are swizzled with the rest of the ingredients.

#Understanding Rum

    notes: If you’re looking for a change of speed, give this combination a try. The Chadburn (named for the Chadburn telegraph) is quite sweet and makes a fine after-dinner drink. But it’s easily converted to a more preprandial version by decreasing the amount of port and pear liqueur to ¼ ounce each.

#Eight Essential Exotic Elixirs
  - name: Planter's Punch
    year: 2009
    notes: This follows the classic rhyming formula, one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak (weak being juices, or in our case, ice). We add two of the most popular ingredients in Jamaica (allspice, Angostura bitters) to round it out and give it depth.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce fresh lime juice
    - ¾ ounce SC Demerara syrup
    - ¼ ounce St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram
    - 3 ounces blended aged rum (Jamaica)
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - "Garnish: Mint Sprig"
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients in a drink mixer tin with 12 ounces of crushed ice and 4 to 6 “agitator” cubes. 
    - Flash blend and then open pour with gated finish into a Collins or highball glass. 
    - Garnish with Jamaican sunshine (oh—and a mint sprig).

    author: Trader Vic
    year: 1946
    notes: Well-known German doctor Bernard Funk was not only Robert Louis Stevenson’s physician and friend, but was also the alleged inventor of an early version of this drink during his many years serving as a doctor to the people of Apia, Samoa. Using a full flavored funky rum (no pun intended) is key to this cocktail as it stands up to and complements the Herbsaint. If Herbsaint is not to your taste, the Trader also made an alternate version called the Dr. Funk’s Son, in which the Herbsaint is dropped, and a ½ ounce of the black pot still unaged rum is substituted with ½ ounce of black blended overproof rum.
    glassware: double rocks
    ingredients:
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice

    author: Steve Crane
    year: 1958
    notes: Steve Crane’s riff on Trader Vic’s iconic drink brings better balance and complexity to this famous recipe. Vic invented the idea of the shared bowl with long straws in the 1940s by reviving the dormant punch tradition and marrying it to the traditions of the kava bowl ceremony, which he witnessed in Micronesia. Serves 4.
    glassware: punch bowl
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces fresh lime juice
    - 4 ounces fresh orange juice
    - 1½ ounces SC Demerara syrup
    - 2 ounces SC Orgeat
    - 2 ounces brandy
    - 4 ounces London Dry Gin
    - 4 ounces blended lightly aged rum
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients in a mixing tin without ice and roll (pour back and forth) with another mixing tin to combine ingredients evenly and split in half. 
    - Add ice to each cup and flash blend with a drink mixer for 3 seconds. 
    - Pour contents of both cups into a 4-person ceramic Scorpion Bowl. 
    - Serve with 20-inch luau straws for easier sharing. 
    - Add fire to taste.

  - name: Fog Cutter
    author: Trader Vic
    notes: Another of Vic’s most famous drinks, the Fog Cutter is still served today at his restaurants around the world. Our version incorporates the pisco preferred by the Don the Beachcomber chain at later locations in their Fog Cutter to give it a brighter, more vegetal character. (We’re trying to make them friends in heaven by fusing their recipes.)

    - 1½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - 1½ ounce fresh orange juice
    - ½ ounce SC Orgeat
    - 1 ounce pisco
    - ½ ounce gin
    - 2 ounces blended lightly aged rum
    - ½ ounce oloroso sherry
