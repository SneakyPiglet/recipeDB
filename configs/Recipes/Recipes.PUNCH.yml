    ingredients:
      - 1 1/2 oz brandy or bourbon
      - 3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice
      - 1/4 ounce Hunt + Alpine Cardamom-Coriander Syrup (see Editor's Note)
      - 1/2 ounce ginger syrup (see Editor's Note)
    steps:
      - Preheat a glass mug by filling it with hot water. Leave the water in for now and set it aside.
      - To prepare the drink, you'll want a heat-conducting vessel that fits into a second container. 
      - Two metal mixing tins work great. Fill the first with enough hot water that the second container floats in the water when placed inside the first. Essentially, you are creating a small bain-marie to preheat the ingredients without diluting them.
      - Add the brandy or bourbon, lemon juice, cardamom-coriander syrup, and ginger syrup to your mixing tins and stir gently until heated through.
      - Empty the water from the preheated mug and immediately fill it with the heated cocktail.
      - Top with 3 ounces of hot water. 
      - Express the Orange twist over the drink, and place the cinnamon stick into the drink.

  - name: The Black Stallion Sets Sail
    author: John Parra & Kyle Hankin
    notes: Consider this a neo-tiki Negroni, with blackstrap rum and Ferrari (Fernet mixed with Campari) taking the place of traditional gin and Campari. Part of the Autostrada menu at Fox Liquor Bar, this drink was inspired by Giuseppe Gonzalez's revamp of the Jungle Bird. The blackstrap rum gives it a rich, molasses-y spice, while the Ferrari offers herbal bitterness.
    ingredients:
    - 3 drops saline solution (Add 1/2 ounce kosher salt to 2 ounces of water and stir until dissolved.)
    - 1 ounce Cocchi di Torino
    - ½ ounce Fernet-Branca
    - ½ ounce Campari
    - 1 ounce blackstrap rum, preferably Cruzan
    - "Garnish: Orange twist"
    steps:
    - In a mixing glass, combine the saline, Cocchi, Ferrari and rum. Add one large cube of ice and stir until very cold.
    - Strain into a rocks glass over large cube of ice. Garnish with Orange twist and serve.

    ingredients:
    - 12 1/2 ounces Tanqueray London Dry gin

  - name: Mott and Mulberry
    author: Leo Robitschek
    notes: Named for an intersection on the border of Little Italy and Chinatown in New York City, the Mott and Mulberry is bartender Leo Robitschek’s autumnal Whiskey Sour riff.

    author: Jeffrey Morogenthaler
    notes: "Bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler of the Clyde Common in Portland, Oregon, created the Flannel Shirt for an autumnal event. Using classic fall flavors—apple, earth, spice and smoke—he whipped up this fleecy, bone-warming drink with the bold backbone of Scotch and a supporting cast of apple cider, St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram and super-bold Averna. Morgenthaler says, “It reminds me of a hot drink that you’d have on Thanksgiving morning—only served cold.”"

  - name: The Barrymore Cocktail
    author: Kenneth McCoy
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/the-barrymore-cocktail/
    notes: "Kenneth McCoy traces the origin of this drink back to a time in which he sampled an array of stirred cocktails in liqueur-rinsed coupes. He found particular harmony between whiskey-based drinks and small amounts of green Chartreuse. “Whether it was a bourbon, a rye, or a single malt, it just elevated the cocktail,” he recalls. “It just gives another edge to the cocktail.”"
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Scotch, preferably Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie
    - 1/2 ounce peated whisky, preferably Compass Box The Peat Monster
    - 1/2 ounce Ramazzotti amaro
    - 1 barspoon green Chartreuse
    - "Garnish: Expressed and discarded Orange twist"
    steps:
    - In a mixing glass, stir first three ingredients with ice.
    - Swirl Chartreuse in a coupe glass, using enough to generously coat the interior. Use a long-handled match to set the liqueur on fire. Swirl the liqueur in the glass for a few seconds. Strain the contents of the mixing glass over the flame to extinguish.
    - Twist orange peel over the drink to express the essential oils. Discard the peel.

    notes: Inspired by the Fault Line, a cocktail from bartender Shannon Tebay at Death & Co., New York, which Alex Jump describes as “arguably one of the best drinks Death & Co. has ever had on a menu,” Another Country reads like a Boulevardier variation. A rye base marries equal parts J. Rieger Caffé Amaro and Cocchi Vermouth di Torino with a small measure of carrot eau de vie.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce rye, preferably Rittenhouse
    - 3/4 ounce J. Rieger Caffé Amaro
    - 3/4 ounce vermouth di Torino, preferably Cocchi
    - 1 teaspoon carrot eau de vie, preferably Reisetbauer

    - Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass over ice and stir until chilled.
    - Strain into a chilled Nick & Nora glass.

  - name: Diamond Fizz Spritz
    author: Isaac Shumway
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/diamond-fizz-spritz/
    notes: The Diamond Fizz was born around the turn of this century, when the fizz was hitting the big time in American bars. A deceptively strong and highly drinkable mixture, it replaces the Gin Fizz’s soda water with Champagne, transforming it into a royale of sorts. Isaac Shumway’s spritz-ified version replaces the gin with Aperol and dry vermouth, the sugar with honey syrup and amaro, and the lemon juice with orange juice. The result is a fluffy orange cloud of a cocktail that tastes something like a bitter Orange Julius.
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2 ounces Aperol
    - 1/4 ounce fresh lemon juice
    - 1/2 ounce dry vermouth, preferably Dolin
    - 1/2 ounce honey syrup (see Editor’s Note)
    - 1/4 ounce Gran Classico Bitter amaro
    - 1 teaspoon fresh orange juice
    - 1 egg white
    - 2 1/2 ounces sparkling wine
    steps:
    - Add the Aperol, lemon juice, vermouth, syrup, Gran Classico, orange juice, and egg white to a cocktail shaker.
    - Shake without ice, and then add ice and shake very hard for 20 seconds.
    - Strain into a Collins glass over a very small amount of ice.
    - Slowly top with the sparkling wine and add the garnish.
    - To make the honey syrup, combine 2 parts honey and 1 part water in a saucepan over very low heat. Stir until the honey is dissolved. Remove from the heat and let sit for at least 30 minutes. Bottle and store in the refrigerator for up to one month.

  - name: Juliet & Romeo
    author: Toby Maloney
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/juliet-romeo/
    notes: When Toby Maloney opened The Violet Hour, one of the first serious craft cocktail bars to open in no-nonsense Chicago, in 2007, he wanted to create a gin cocktail that would appeal to gin haters. The result was the Juliet & Romeo, a mix of gin, lime juice, cucumber, sugar, mint, salt and rose water. “I wanted it to taste like a walk through an English garden,” says Maloney. His plan succeeded. The drink has been among the top two sellers for the last 12 years; in 2019, the bar sold an average of 20 a day. To put that in perspective, only the Old-Fashioned sells more. “It’s as close to a house drink as we have,” says Maloney. It’s also jumped to other bars in town. The day Maloney sees it on the most menus? Valentine’s Day, naturally.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces London Dry gin
    - 3/4 ounce lime juice
    - 3/4 ounce simple syrup
    - 3 slices cucumber
    - 1 mint sprig
    - pinch of salt
    - "Garnish: mint leaf, 1 dash of rosewater, 3 dashes of Angostura bitters."
    steps:
    - Combine cucumber and salt in a mixing tin and muddle.
    - Add all remaining ingredients and shake with ice.
    - Strain into a chilled coupe.
    - Garnish with mint leaf, 1 dash of rosewater on the mint leaf and 3 dashes of Angostura bitters.

    notes: The late bar legend Gary “Gaz” Regan published his Valentino recipe in his groundbreaking book The Joy of Mixology. Beginning with the Negroni template, Regan departed from the equal-parts ratio, swapped gin for vodka and served the drink up for a cocktail that he describes as “far different from the Negroni.”
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces vodka
    - 1/2 ounce Campari
    - 1/2 ounce sweet vermouth
    - "Garnish: Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass with ice and stir until chilled.
    - Strain into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass.
    - Garnish with an orange twist.

  - name: Accomplice’s Glögg
    author: Gabriella Mlynarczyk
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/accomplices-glogg/
    notes: In making this “Viking-tiki”-inspired Swedish glögg, bartender Gabriella Mlynarczyk found that aquavit is a good partner for tropical ingredients, like allspice dram, pineapple and vanilla-inflected velvet falernum (though rum or even brandy can be substituted in this recipe). She recommends using a full-bodied, even jammy, bottle of wine to give the drink a generous fruitiness that’s balanced by warming spices, like ginger and pink peppercorns. Serves 4 to 6.
    ingredients:
    - 1 750mL bottle dry red wine
    - 2 cups velvet falernum
    - 2 ounces allspice dram
    - 2 cups pineapple juice
    - 1/2 cup aquavit, rum or brandy
    - steeping ingredients (peel of 1 orange; peel of 1 lime; 5 cloves; 2 cinnamon sticks; 2 to 3 slices fresh ginger; 1 teaspoon szechuan or pink peppercorns; 3 bay leaves)
    - sugar, to taste (optional)
    steps:
    - Place the steeping ingredients on a square of cheesecloth, then bring the corners together and tie them securely with kitchen twine to make a "teabag." Then, place in a large pot.
    - Add all of the liquid ingredients, to the pot, except for the aquavit.
    - Place the pot over low heat and simmer the mixture for 20 minutes, then remove from the heat.
    - Add the aquavit and ladel the mulled wine into mugs, adding sugar to taste (if desired).
    - Garnish with an orange peel and a cinnamon stick or a sprig of pink peppercorns.

    notes: Imagine a Manhattan—rich, dark and spicy—but with a layer of chocolate nudged in between the whiskey and the bitters. This is Sean Hoard’s Fox River, which takes an American classic and dresses it up in a fur stole of homemade crème de cacao and a dash of luxurious demerara syrup.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces bourbon or rye
    - 1/2 ounce crème de cacao, Teardrop's DIY recipe
    - "1/2 teaspoon rich demerara syrup(2:1, demerara sugar: water)"
    - 2 dashes peach bitters
    - "Garnish: 1 lemon peel"
    steps:

  - name: Brave Benbow
    author: Natasha David
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/brave-benbow/
    notes: While consulting for British-themed bar and restaurant Dear Bushwick, Natasha David envisioned the menu as the documented travels of a Naval officer sailing around the world. “I always think of salt and Campari as going well together,” says David of combining the Italian bitter with salted lime cordial. “I think of them like herbs and salt in cooking—they have the ability to bring everything together.” A loose play on the Gin Sour, the Brave Benbow combines two historic styles of gin—Navy strength and Old Tom—and is named for a British admiral.
    ingredients:
    - 3/4 ounce navy strength gin (preferably Perry's Tot)
    - 3/4 ounce Old Tom gin (preferably Hayman's)
    - 1/4 ounce Campari
    - 1 1/2 ounces salted lime cordial (see Editor's Note below)
    - "Garnish: 2 kaffir lime leaves"
    steps:
    - Add all ingredients to a cocktail shaker.
    - Add ice and shake until chilled.
    - Strain into a chilled coupe or cocktail glass.
    - Garnish with makrut lime leaves.
    - To make salted lime cordial, combine 1 cup fresh lime juice, 2/3 cups of super fine sugar, and ¼ teaspoon salt in a blender. Blend until combined. Will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

  - name: White Bull
    author: Christiaan Rollich
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/white-bull/
    notes: "At first attempting to riff on a Blood and Sand, Christiaan Rollich of AOC in Los Angeles created the White Bull almost by accident. Getting lost somewhere between adding and subtracting different ingredients, a new drink was born: gin instead of scotch, sage beer syrup instead of cherry liqueur, and the addition of Cocchi Americano, lemon, angostura and Hefeweizen. Served in a Collins glass with a sage leaf garnish, Rollich credits the name to removing the ‘blood’ part of a Blood and Sand and replacing it with a white beer for what drinks like a winter shandy."
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce gin (preferably Death's Door)
    - 1 ounce Cocchi Americano
    - 3/4 ounce hefeweizen beer
    - 3/4 ounce sage beer syrup (see Editor's Note)
    - 1 ounce lemon juice
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - "Garnish: sage leaves"
    steps:
    - To make the Sage Beer Syrup, add one 12-ounce bottle of hefeweizen, 1 1/2 cups sugar and 12 fresh sage leaves to a saucepan. Bring to a boil and stir to dissolve sugar. Turn heat off, cool and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
    - Add all ingredients to a cocktail shaker.
    - Add ice and shake until chilled.
    - Strain over ice into a Collins glass.
    - Garnish with sage leaves.

    author: 
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/hot-penicillin/
    notes: Named for its so-called healing properties, the Penicillin—bartender Sam Ross’ smoky and spicy twist on a Whiskey Sour—has become a modern classic in the cocktail canon. Victoria presents a cold-weather update by warming it up, literally, with hot apple cider sweetened with a fragrant honey syrup. The familiar Scotch whisky of the original gets a spicy kick of ginger root from Fever-TreeGinger Beer, and added brightness from fresh lemon. “It’s warming, with a smoky spice flavor,” she says, “and perfect for transitioning into winter.”
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Monkey Shoulder Blended Malt Scotch Whisky
    - 1 ounce hot apple cider
    - 1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice
    - 1/4 ounce honey syrup (2:1 honey to water)
    - Fever-TreeGinger Beer
    steps:
    - Temper a mug with hot water to warm.
    - Discard hot water and combine Scotch, cider, lemon juice and honey syrup in the mug.
    - Top with Fever-TreeGinger Beer.
    - Garnish with a lemon wheel.

    author: Leanne Favre
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/negroni-de-nubes/
    notes: Created in collaboration with fellow New York bartenders Tom Macy and Shannon Ponche, the Negroni de Nubes is not your average Negroni variation. Unsmoked mezcal forms the base, leaving room for the delicate flavors of a strawberry-infused Cappelletti-Suze mixture and the botanicals of blanc vermouth to shine through. “It just needed one final touch,” recalls Leanne Favre. “I had the idea to use rice to contribute texture and mouthfeel, drawing inspiration from the starchy texture of horchata.” Stirring the mixture with a few tablespoons of rice acts as an à la minute rice wash that lends texture and “delightful creaminess” to the drink.
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/4 ounces mezcal, preferably Derrumbes San Luis Potosí
    - 1 ounce blanc vermouth, preferably Dolin
    - 3/4 ounce strawberry infused Suze-Cappelletti mixture (see Editor's Note)
    - 1 dash saline
    - 2 tablespoons rice
    - "Garnish: grapefruit twist"
    steps:

    notes: Honorable mention at our blind rum Old-Fashioned tasting went to Ryan Lotz of Shore Leave in Boston, whose recipe one panelist called “zippy” with a “bracing quality,” a key attribute to the Old-Fashioned format. It was considered by the judges to represent the ideal rum Old-Fashioned for rye drinkers. As bar owner Paul McGee observed, “this is how you convert whiskey drinkers.”

Paired with the distinctive botanical profile of Monkey 47 gin and a finishing spray of the potent Chartreuse Élixir Végétal, the drink has a freshness and depth of flavor that set it apart from the very first sip. When preparing this recipe, rather than converting to ounces, we suggest using a measuring cup with milliliter demarcations for a more precise result. Serves 9."

    notes: "The Boulevardier has been on the menu since the opening of The Long Island Bar in 2013. “I tried to take if off the menu after six months and people screamed bloody murder,” says Toby Cecchini. Often credited with exhuming the recipe from obscurity, Cecchini’s version calls on two full ounces of rye, split between Rittenhouse and Old Overholt, and a split vermouth component to keep every element in balance with the Campari."
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Old Overholt Straight Rye Whiskey
    - 1 ounce Rittenhouse Rye 100-Proof
    - 1 ounce Campari

    author: Hayley Wilson
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/color-in-your-cheeks/
    notes: Hayley Wilson created Color in Your Cheeks to highlight how well Fernet-Branca can play with citrus. The Fernet is bolstered by Vermont maple syrup and Laird’s Applejack Brandy to create a silky-smooth sour with a bitter bite on the end. “I think the Applejack brings some much-needed proof to this drink, while the maple syrup adds body and depth,” says Wilson “This is such a great fall cocktail that captures the flavors of the seasons changing in New England.”
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/4 ounces Fernet-Branca
    - 1/2 ounce applejack, preferably Laird's
    - 3/4 ounce lemon juice
    - 3/4 ounce grade A Vermont maple syrup
    - 1/2 ounce egg white
    steps:

    notes: "Portland’s Jeffrey Morgenthaler first discovered the Jägerita in London back in 2008 and was instantly enamored by it. “It’s basically an amaro sour, which is a type of drink I really love,” he says. “So it only seemed natural to try it frozen.” The recipe—perfected by Morganthaler’s former colleague, David Cordoba—delivers a playful and bitter take on a frozen Margarita. Pairing Jägermeister with sweet cointreau, lime and syrup, the Jägerita makes for an unexpectedly sophisticated frozen drink."
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2 ounce Jägermeister
    - 3/4 ounce Cointreau
    - 3/4 ounce lime juice
    - 3/4 ounce simple syrup
    - "Garnish: lime wheel"
    steps:
    - Add all ingredients to a blender.
    - Add ice, about six ounces crushed.
    - Blend until smooth.
    - Pour into a glass and garnish with a lime wheel.

    notes: “Jagermeister is nice burned,” says Dave Arnold. “A lot of bitter liqueurs are nice when they are burned.” For this drink, he applies a flame to caramelize the sugar in the liqueur as well as to heat it, yielding a warming, gently spiced drink.
    ingredients:
    - 2 teaspoons sugar
    - 2 ounces Jägermeister
    - 1/4 ounce lemon juice
    - 1 pinch salt
    - 2 ounces water
    - orange twist
    steps:
    - Heat sugar in a saucepan, until caramelized.
    - Add Jägermeister, lemon juice and salt to pan.
    - Use a long-handled match or kitchen torch to apply flame to the contents of the pan; it should catch fire.
    - Add water, dousing the fire. Add more water if needed to extinguish the flame.
    - Scrape the insides of the pan and briefly stir to combine.
    - Pour into mug and garnish with orange twist.

    notes: Spawned in the late aughts at LAB—London’s influential high-energy, high-volume bar—this spin on a classic has had a cult following since its creation in 2005. More recently, the drink has united online cocktail enthusiasts who are in search of the best substitute for green Chartreuse, the drink’s key ingredient, which has become increasingly scarce. 
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce overproof unaged Jamaican rum, preferably Wray & Nephew
    - 1 ounce lime juice
    - 3/4 ounce green Chartreuse

    notes: At his Lisbon kiosk, Quiosque de São Paulo, André Magalhães balances fragrant, sweet Amarguinha, a Portuguese bitter-almond liqueur, with equal parts fresh-squeezed lemon juice, serving the drink over ice, with lemon peel for an additional hit of aroma. This recipe calls for one and a half ounces each of Amarguinha and lemon juice, but you should be generous with your pours—Magalhães certainly is. Portugal’s iconic brand of bitter-almond liqueur, Amarguinha, is available at a handful of shops in the United States.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 1/2 ounces fresh-squeezed lemon juice, chilled
    - 1 1/2 ounces Amarguinha, chilled
    - "Garnish: swath of lemon peel"
    steps:
    - Combine the lemon juice and Amarguinha in a rocks glass just short of filled with ice cubes, and stir until chilled.
    - Rub the edge of the glass with the lemon peel, then add to the drink.

    notes: At Vals in New Orleans, Margarita specials rotate based on the season. The Mango Margarita is a refreshing combination of tequila, sugar, lime juice, orange liqueur and puréed mango. It’s typically made in a frozen-drink machine, but this version is scaled down for a home blender.
    ingredients: 
    - 16 ounces frozen chunks of mango (freshly cut then frozen, or store-bought)
    - 15 ounces (a scant 2 cups) blanco tequila, preferably Tequila Ocho Plata
    - 10 ounces (about 1 ¼ cups) lime juice
    - 5 ounces orange liqueur, preferably Cointreau or Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao
    - 2 ounces mezcal, preferably Del Maguey Vida
    - 2 ounces simple syrup
    - "Garnish: lime wedge"
    steps:
    - Blend all ingredients together until smooth. Set mixture aside. (This should make about 1 1/2 quarts of blended ingredients, which can be kept in the refrigerator until ready to serve).
    - "When ready to serve: To achieve the desired frozen texture, add ice cubes to the mixture bit by bit, and blend to desired texture."
    - Serves 6.

    notes: "The Stone Raft is a weird one,” says Phil Ward of the New York agave den Mayahuel. “I figured that people weren’t going to like it or order it, but I thought it was so god-damn good I put it on the menu anyway.” A combination of amontillado, mezcal, jalapeño tequila, celery bitters, and a barspoon of agave nectar, the Stone Raft is a distant cousin of the Oaxaca Old-Fashioned, one of the first drinks Ward ever made with mezcal. The Stone Raft was born out of a long line of riffs on the drink. The adamantly savory combination of herbal-smoky-nutty is unusual, but despite Ward’s prediction that the drink would be met with sneers, it went on to become the obsession of many fans of Mayahuel and has been a mainstay until the bar’s closure in 2017."
    ingredients: 
    - 1 1/2 ounces amontillado

Served in an irresistible diminutive glass, the frosty, unconventional serve recalls one of the most iconic Martinis of all: the shot-glass Martini of Harry’s Bar in Venice. The drink itself is classic, too—a simple 2-1 ratio of Japanese gin to dry vermouth—but with a thoroughly modern twist courtesy of an “umami bomb” infusion. For a traditionally sized serving, simply double the recipe."

It’s involved, but worth the effort."

The fermented chile paste adds a nuanced spice, complemented by the sweetness of the honey, which is reinforced through a splash of pineapple rum. “I think that there is a reason to celebrate these flavors, to bring them to the forefront without having to be gimmicky,” says Luthman."

  - name: Poncha Regional
    author: Ilda Marques
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/poncha-regional/
    notes: In this version of Madeira’s signature drink, a bit of lemon zest is added to the traditional ingredients of rhum agricole, citrus juice and honey. In Ilda Marques’ words, the ingredient lends the drink a bit more “creaminess,” and it provides an additional hit of citrus tartness and aroma to counter the sweetness of the honey. On Madeira, poncha is made exclusively with locally made white rhum agricole. This recipe was made using Branca 40 percent, made by Engenhos do Norte, a standard product on the island. In the U.S., Madeiran rum is nearly impossible to find, so look for any other unaged rhum agricole between 80 and 100 proof. It’s also unlikely you’ll be able to find an authentic caralhinho, the wooden tool used to “whip” the drink, but a wooden spoon does the job.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 swaths of lemon peel (around 3 grams total)
    - 1/2 teaspoon white sugar
    - scant 1 1/2 ounces white rhum agricole, chilled
    - scant 1 1/2 ounces fresh-squeezed orange juice, chilled
    - 1 ounce fresh-squeezed lemon juice, chilled
    - 1 teaspoon honey
    steps:
    - In a heavy pint glass (or small glass pitcher, if making more than one drink), muddle the lemon peel and sugar, pounding and grinding until you have a uniform paste.
    - Add the rhum agricole, lemon juice, orange juice and honey. Holding a caralhinho (or wooden spoon) between your palms, insert it in the mixture and spin it until the ingredients are integrated and frothy.
    - Taste, adding more lemon juice or honey depending on the flavor of your ingredients; it should be just barely sweet followed by tart and fragrant flavors.
    - Strain the mixture through a sieve into a small, stemmed glass or alternatively, over ice into a tall glass.

    notes: "Essentially a Gin Sour made with lime juice, legend has it that the Gimlet was created in the mid-19th century to encourage Royal Navy sailors to consume their rations of scurvy-preventing lime juice. The name? Possibly a reference to Thomas Desmond Gimlette, a naval medical officer who served during that era. Rose’s Lime Cordial, a syrup of sugar and lime juice, was invented around the same time to preserve lime juice during long bouts at sea; fundamentalist versions of the drink still call for it. The Rose’s of today, however, is a different animal, with high-fructose corn syrup and additives—stuff that wouldn’t make it past the door of any self-respecting craft cocktail bar. This version is Brooklyn bartender Toby Cecchini’s rendition, which he serves at The Long Island Bar on Atlantic Avenue. His Gimlet is infused with ginger-lime cordial and served on the rocks."

    notes: "Created for a local cocktail competition, the Perá Fortuna builds from a classic Gimlet structure, adding spiced pear liqueur, absinthe and celery bitters. “A drink I used to make all the time was a gin, lime, absinthe Collins,” recalls Richard Beltzer of the inspiration. Turning the drink into a shorter format allowed the flavors to stand out in stronger concentration, but the finishing touch came from introducing absinthe back into the equation. “I realized the drink needed more body,” explains Beltzer, “and absinthe is like a cheat code.”"
    ingredients: 
    - 1/8 ounce absinthe, preferably Germaine Robin
    - 3 dashes celery bitters, preferably Fee Brothers

    notes: "Named after the French word for arugula, the Roquette is Los Angeles bartender Matthew Biancaniello’s riff on a Gimlet made with arugula. “It’s somewhere between an arugula gimlet and a gin mojito,” he says. Biancaniello muddles a big handful of spicy arugula rustica he gets from a Southern California purveyor into agave syrup and fresh lime juice before adding organic gin from Colorado. The result is a tree-frog green cocktail with a piquant tang that he pours up or over a large cube of ice."

In a cheeky nod to her favorite part of the dessert, she garnishes the drink with a bite-size rice crispy treat. “It all rounds out to be just like a beautiful flip cocktail,” says Natoli.

    author: Eric Simmons
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/diamond-noir/
    notes: Key to the success of the Diamond Noir is the fat-washing process that lends the drink its unexpected velvety texture. Eric Simmons takes a milk punch–inspired approach by filtering the entire cocktail—bourbon, yuzu juice, lemon juice and Demerara syrup—through heavy cream. The final product is then topped with a cabernet float, yielding a New York Sour–adjacent cocktail that feels right at home against a menu of pasta and Italian wine. As Simmons explains, “It has all the [elements of] the restaurant tied into one drink.”
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces overproof bourbon
    - 1/2 ounce yuzu juice
    - 1/2 ounce lemon juice
    - 3/4 ounce burnt demerara syrup
    - 1/4 ounce amontillado sherry
    - 4 ounces heavy cream
    - cabernet, to float
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients, except for the wine, and freeze for one hour.
    - Strain the mixture through a coffee filter until clarified.
    - In a mixing glass, stir the clarified mixture with ice until properly diluted.
    - Strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.

    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 375 milliliters (½ bottle) rhum agricole, preferably Clement Select Barrel
    - 375 milliliters (½ bottle) rum, preferably Real McCoy 5 Year Barbados Rum
    - 375 milliliters (½ bottle) Velvet Falernum
    - 100 milliliters lime juice
    - 50 milliliters water
    - 4 dashes Angostura Bitters
    - 4 ounces half and half
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients, except the half and half, in an 8 quart container.
    - In a separate 8 quart container, add half and half.
    - Pour the cocktail mixture (the first container) over the half and half and let sit for 30 minutes. You should see the punch curdle, this is a good thing. Line a fine mesh strainer with a damp cloth napkin or cheese cloth and place strainer over a deli container and slowly pour about 8 ounces of the mixture through the cloth. The first liquid coming through will be a bit hazy so move the strainer to another container and continue to let the mixture slowly collect into the container. Continue to pour more of the mixture through the strainer. It will yield around 2 deli containers.
    - Place punch in refrigerator and pour 3 to 4 ounces over a big ice cube whenever you like.

    notes: “I wanted to create a cocktail that kind of encapsulates the Filipino American experience,” says Napier Bulanan, who translates the ubiquitous fruit punch of family gatherings into cocktail form. A base of lambanog, a distilled palm spirit, is bolstered by aquavit, sweetened with lychee syrup and given a tart kick from fresh lime juice. The whole mixture is then clarified, milk punch–style, using coconut milk.  Serves 10.
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 15 ounces lambanog, preferably Infanta
    - 10 ounces Aquavit, preferably Ahus
    - 7 1/2 ounces lychee syrup (see Editor’s Note)
    - 5 ounces lime juice
    - 9 ounces full-fat coconut milk
    - "Garnish: a spritz of pinipig tincture and an orchid"

    - Combine the first four ingredients in a large container to create a cocktail mixture.
    - Pour the coconut milk into a separate large container, then add the cocktail mixture. Stir the mixture and let rest for 30 minutes.
    - Line a large chinois with a clean kitchen napkin, and set it inside a large container. Slowly pour the mixture through the chinois. (You may have to pour it in batches, because the straining process takes time.) Pour the clarified cocktail into a reusable bottle and refrigerate.
    - When ready to serve, pour 3 ounces of the mixture into a mixing glass with ice, and strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.

    notes: How do you take a drink whose essence relies on both a beach and a blender and make it the sort of drink you’d sip near the fire? The Piña Colada so singularly symbolizes summer it seems an almost impossible feat to make it winter appropriate. Almost. This here Piña Colada Milk Punch maintains the essence of the drink’s tropical spirit with coconut water, pineapple juice, rum (and velvet falernum for extra credit), but it’s transformed by adding scalded milk, clarifying the mixture with a cheese cloth and then ladling it, punch-style, on the rocks. Serves 8-10.
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 14 ounces aged rum, preferably Plantation 5-Year
    - 8 ounces coconut water
    - 4 ounces velvet falernum
    - 1 ounce demerara syrup (1:1, sugar:water)
    - 4 ounces pineapple juice
    - 3 ounces lime juice
    - 6 ounces milk
    - "Garnish: pineapple slice, maraschino cherry"
    steps:
    - Pour the rum, coconut water, Velvet falernum, pineapple juice, lime juice, and demerara syrup into a heatsafe mixing bowl.
    - Over medium-low heat, heat the milk in a saucepan, stirring continuously until the milk begins to bubble around the edges (taking care not to let it boil).
    - Add the milk to the mixing bowl, stir until it begins to coagulate, and let the mixture sit for 15 minutes.
    - Strain through a cheesecloth or coffee filter until the mixture is clarified.

    - Reduce heat to medium and let simmer uncovered for 15 minutes.
    - Remove from heat and add sugar and tea. Stir until sugar is fully dissolved and let cool.
    - In a separate large mixing bowl, combine the milk with the lemon juice and stir. Let sit for 15 minutes to allow milk to curdle.
    - Add remaining ingredients, including the reduced cola mixture, to the bowl with the curdled milk.
    - Line a colander with a clean kitchen towel or apron (making sure the full interior is covered) and place over stock pot.

    notes: "A supercharged formula dating back to the halcyon days of New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel, the Chauncey stands out due to its unusual triple base: gin, whiskey and Cognac in equal measure, along with vermouth and orange bitters. Waldorf Astoria Bar Book author Frank Caiafa encourages experimentation and personalization when approaching this recipe. Though he opts for a bold gin in the 96-proof Bowling and Burch, matched with the gentler H by Hine Cognac and Ragtime Rye, you can just as easily emphasize a big-flavor brandy or whiskey."

Named after Francisco Villaruel Guilledo, a Filipino flyweight boxing champ who went by the name “Pancho Villa,”  the original drink went heavy on the gin and fruit liqueurs. Manila native Marlo Gamora’s version, which he developed for the East Village Filipino restaurant Jeepney, is a more rum-centric endeavor, with dialed-in proportions to better calibrate the sour and the sweet."

    notes: "When on the hunt for a lesser-known rum classic, Jewel Murray and her team workshopped several cocktails from The Savoy Cocktail Book until they found a winner: the Pauline. Bartender Daniel Sanchez spearheaded the development of the spec, which leans on an unusual Haitian rum that combines two clairins and an unaged rum. The wormwood bitters of the original recipe are here replaced by a combination of absinthe and orange bitters, while the original recipe’s nutmeg had to stay for this winterized rum sour."

While Harry Craddock’s original recipe calls for sweet Italian vermouth, Portland, Maine-based bartender LyAnna Sanabria subs in the semi-sweet Comoz Blanc providing a brighter canvas for her spring-friendly rendition. Bimini Coconut Gin, from Maine’s Round Turn Distilling, and Capurro Acholado Pisco are the lighter stand-ins for the London dry gin and Cognac specified in the pages of Savoy.

Probably not, but Takoi beverage director Drew Pompa thinks it deserves a fair shake nonetheless.

It sounds like it shouldn’t work—and it really doesn’t, at least as originally constituted. But something about the Hot Pants intrigued Tammy Bouma, inspiring her to update the oddball sour for modern tastes. Her version omits peppermint schnapps in favor of a fresh mint tea syrup.

    notes: Though it has the air of a pre-Prohibition cocktail, the Cloister actually originates with the Playboy Bartender’s Guide, published in 1971. A gin sour that relies on two types of citrus, its monastic name is a nod to its inclusion of yellow Chartreuse, the complex herbal liqueur produced by the Carthusian monks of southeastern France. For New Orleans bartender Christina Rando, It’s the ideal “gateway” drink capable of converting skeptics into avowed Chartreuse fans. She prefers this variation from Jim Meehan’s 2011 PDT Cocktail Book, which introduces a touch of simple syrup to counterbalance the fresh grapefruit and lemon.

A measure of funky Jamaican rum provides extra fortification in this version that was a staple of the now-closed Brooklyn bar Dram, where Oertel first created it.
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 1 1/2 ounce Campari
    - 3/4 ounce aged Jamaican rum, preferably Smith & Cross
    - 1/2 ounce orange curaçao
    - 3/4 ounce orgeat
    - 1 ounce lime juice
    - "Garnish: mint bouquet"
    steps:
    - Combine all the ingredients in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake until chilled, about 10 seconds.
    - Strain into a large rocks glass over crushed ice.
    - Garnish with mint sprig.

    notes: The Army Navy, also known as the Army & Navy, dates to at least the 1930s. A cousin of contemporary orgeat sours like the Cameron’s Kick and Coo-ee Special, it’s evidence of an orgeat boom that predates tropical drinks like the Mai Tai. At Dutch Kills, the house Army & Navy spec honors longtime regular and retired FDNY firefighter Lou, who prefers hers with a cocktail cherry sunk to the bottom of the coupe and Angostura bitters dashed on top.

    notes: Second place in our freezer Martini tasting was won by Julie Reiner, co-owner of the Brooklyn bars Clover Club and Leyenda. The tasters found it well-integrated and delicate, with none of the drink’s flavors dominating. “It makes me want more with each sip,” said PUNCH senior editor Chloe Frechette. “A very good before-dinner Martini,” noted bartender Meaghan Dorman. (Don’t look for this drink among the to-go offerings at Clover Club—it is Reiner’s at-home go-to.) Yields 750ml.

    notes: The winner of our Zombie blind tasting, Anton Kinloch’s recipe was the only one of eight in which the grenadine was perceptible, thanks to the fact that Kinloch acidifies his syrup to make it pop, even when a mere tablespoon is used. For the rum, Kinloch is true to the hard-hitting nature of the original and blends one and a half ounces each of Puerto Rican and Jamaican rums, with another ounce of overproof Demerara rum. “You can taste the layers,” noted one of the panelists. Though Kinloch serves his Zombie clarified, the recipe below is for the nonclarified version that won our blind tasting.

    notes: Taking second place in our Zombie blind tasting, Chris Coy’s recipe stood out for its rich, velvety mouthfeel, an exceedingly difficult quality to achieve in a drink prepared via spindle blender, which can easily overdilute a drink and make it feel thin. To thank for that is a rich honey syrup that complements the requisite cinnamon syrup and falernum. “It’s so hard to get the texture right with this drink, and this one nailed it,” said Garret Richard, a judge on the tasting panel.

    notes: "Taking third place in our Zombie blind tasting, this recipe is bold and spice-forward, with a thoughtful, theatrical and aromatic garnish: An inverted lime shell is filled with overproof Demerara rum, topped with a few drops of absinthe and Angostura bitters, and then ignited, dusted with nutmeg and poured over the drink. Chantal Tseng was the only bartender in the tasting to opt for a measure of rhum agricole—a half-ounce, which she paired with overproof Jamaican and Demerara rums. Though the absinthe—a full quarter-ounce, compared to the drops and dashes of most other recipes—tilted the drink away from the archetype, it still stuck in the judges’ minds after tasting (and re-tasting) the lineup."
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 1 lime shell

    steps:
    - Add all ingredients to a shaker and shake with cracked ice for a quick and hard 5 seconds.
    - Double-strain into a chilled large Collins glass, ceramic mug or Hurricane glass.
    - Fill with crushed ice and stir quickly with a long metal spoon, then insert a straw.
    - Re-top with crushed ice.
    - To garnish, tuck a bunch of fresh mint leaves into the edge of the glass, then fan them out. Spear an optional Luxardo or marasca cherry into the mint.
    - Place an inverted lime shell on top and fill with about 1/2 ounce Hamilton 151-proof Demerara rum, a few drops of absinthe and an extra dash of Angostura bitters.
    - Light the shell on fire and grate nutmeg over the top.
    - After blowing out the fire, dump the contents of the lime over the drink and sip from the straw.

I struggled to mix it for weeks, and finally, on the verge of despair I decided to try it with green chartreuse.” The result is the Dead celebrity, a somewhat unlikely mix of sherry, green Chartreuse, Scotch and lemon and rhubarb bitters."

With this blueprint in mind, Farran substituted American whiskey with the subtly complex Yamazaki, while adding layers to the sweet vermouth via the addition of spicy Cardamaro and saffron-infused Strega. Farran named his cocktail in reference to the third installment of the Fast and the Furious movies, which he thinks, “is pretty hilarious.”

    notes: A milk-washed riff on a Vieux Carré—“we swapped every ingredient, except Bénédictine,” Daniel Villa says—this drink uses toasted powdered milk to yield a silky cocktail that tastes “as though it was simultaneously milk-punched and brown-butter fat-washed.” The sunken raisin garnish is a bonus. “It’s almost a rum raisin cure in the drink,” he says. “By the time you’re done, they’re delicious, and you can enjoy them at the end as a snack.” Yields one 750ml bottle, or about eight 3-ounce servings.
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 8 ounces rehydrated toasted whole milk (see Editor’s Note)
    - 9 ounces reposado tequila, preferably El Tesoro
    - 6 ounces amontillado sherry
    - 3 ounces Pedro Ximénez sherry
    - 2 ounces mezcal, preferably Ilegal Joven
    - 1 1/2 ounces Bénédictine
    - 1 1/2 ounces Cynar
    - 1/2 teaspoon bitters (Villa prefers Crude Cardamom & Caramelized Raisin bitters, a limited-edition bottling, but says an equal amount of any style of bitters will work)
    steps:
    - Pour the rehydrated milk into a large mixing cup or Cambro.
    - In a second container, add the remaining ingredients, and stir to combine. Add the batched cocktail into the container with the rehydrated milk. Give it a gentle stir, and let it sit for about 10 minutes, during which it should curdle.
    - Pour the cocktail mixture through a fine-mesh sieve (a chinois strainer lined with a moistened linen towel or a micron bag/Superbag will also work) into a clean container. The resulting liquid should be slightly cloudy.
    - Pour the cocktail mixture a second time through the same sieve (including through the curds in the sieve) into a clean container. The resulting liquid should be fairly clear.
    - Funnel into a bottle and cap. Keeps, indefinitely, at room temperature.
    - To serve, pour 3 ounces over big ice, and stir to chill.
    - Garnish with raisins, which should sink to the bottom of the glass.

    notes: At Boston’s Eastern Standard, bar manager Diego Peña takes inspiration from a London Fog (essentially an Earl Grey tea latte) in this wintry milk punch. It calls for a warming blend of bourbon, brandy and rum alongside Earl Grey syrup. Yields 3 quarts.
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 2 cups bourbon
    - 1 cup brandy
    - 3/4 cup Jamaican rum
    - "1 3/4 cup Earl Grey syrup (1:1 earl grey tea:granulated sugar)"
    - 1 3/4 cup lemon juice
    - 1 2/3 cup whole milk
    - 3/4 cup half and half
    - Zest of one lemon (optional)
    - 1 dash vanilla extract (optional)
    - "Garnish: grated nutmeg"
    steps:
    - Add all ingredients, except milk and half and half (plus lemon and vanilla, if using), to a nonreactive container.
    - Combine the milk, half and half, lemon zest and vanilla over in a pot over the stove and heat to 180ºF.
    - Add milk to the nonreactive container and allow it to rest for approximately 3 minutes.
    - In a clean container, place a mesh strainer with a single thin layer of cheesecloth or coffee filter on top. Start the straining process by allowing the punch to pass through. Do not remove the curds—they help with the clarification. When you notice the rate of liquid passing through has slowed down, transfer the curd-filled strainer into a clean container.
    - Add the contents from the other container to the top of the strainer and slowly top of until its completely passed through. It takes some time depending on the batch.
    - Serve in a rocks glass over a large ice cube.
    - Garnish with grated nutmeg.

    - 2 ounces mezcal, preferably Del Maguey Vida
    - 2 ounces simple syrup
    - "Garnish: lime wedge"

    - Blend all ingredients together until smooth. Set mixture aside. (This should make about 1 1/2 quarts of blended ingredients, which can be kept in the refrigerator until ready to serve).
    - "When ready to serve: To achieve the desired frozen texture, add ice cubes to the mixture bit by bit, and blend to desired texture."

The Stone Raft was born out of a long line of riffs on the drink. The adamantly savory combination of herbal-smoky-nutty is unusual, but despite Ward’s prediction that the drink would be met with sneers, it went on to become the obsession of many fans of Mayahuel and has been a mainstay until the bar’s closure in 2017."

The drink itself is classic, too—a simple 2-1 ratio of Japanese gin to dry vermouth—but with a thoroughly modern twist courtesy of an “umami bomb” infusion. For a traditionally sized serving, simply double the recipe."

The fermented chile paste adds a nuanced spice, complemented by the sweetness of the honey, which is reinforced through a splash of pineapple rum. “I think that there is a reason to celebrate these flavors, to bring them to the forefront without having to be gimmicky,” says Luthman."
    ingredients: 
    - 1 1/2 ounces whiskey, preferably Old Overholt Bottled-in-Bond
    - 1/2 ounce pineapple rum, preferably Plantation Stiggin’s

  - name: Poncha Regional
    author: Ilda Marques
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/poncha-regional/
    notes: In this version of Madeira’s signature drink, a bit of lemon zest is added to the traditional ingredients of rhum agricole, citrus juice and honey. In Ilda Marques’ words, the ingredient lends the drink a bit more “creaminess,” and it provides an additional hit of citrus tartness and aroma to counter the sweetness of the honey. On Madeira, poncha is made exclusively with locally made white rhum agricole. This recipe was made using Branca 40 percent, made by Engenhos do Norte, a standard product on the island. In the U.S., Madeiran rum is nearly impossible to find, so look for any other unaged rhum agricole between 80 and 100 proof. It’s also unlikely you’ll be able to find an authentic caralhinho, the wooden tool used to “whip” the drink, but a wooden spoon does the job.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 swaths of lemon peel (around 3 grams total)
    - 1/2 teaspoon white sugar
    - scant 1 1/2 ounces white rhum agricole, chilled
    - scant 1 1/2 ounces fresh-squeezed orange juice, chilled
    - 1 ounce fresh-squeezed lemon juice, chilled
    - 1 teaspoon honey
    steps:
    - In a heavy pint glass (or small glass pitcher, if making more than one drink), muddle the lemon peel and sugar, pounding and grinding until you have a uniform paste.
    - Add the rhum agricole, lemon juice, orange juice and honey. Holding a caralhinho (or wooden spoon) between your palms, insert it in the mixture and spin it until the ingredients are integrated and frothy.
    - Taste, adding more lemon juice or honey depending on the flavor of your ingredients; it should be just barely sweet followed by tart and fragrant flavors.
    - Strain the mixture through a sieve into a small, stemmed glass or alternatively, over ice into a tall glass.

    notes: "Essentially a Gin Sour made with lime juice, legend has it that the Gimlet was created in the mid-19th century to encourage Royal Navy sailors to consume their rations of scurvy-preventing lime juice. The name? Possibly a reference to Thomas Desmond Gimlette, a naval medical officer who served during that era. Rose’s Lime Cordial, a syrup of sugar and lime juice, was invented around the same time to preserve lime juice during long bouts at sea; fundamentalist versions of the drink still call for it. The Rose’s of today, however, is a different animal, with high-fructose corn syrup and additives—stuff that wouldn’t make it past the door of any self-respecting craft cocktail bar. This version is Brooklyn bartender Toby Cecchini’s rendition, which he serves at The Long Island Bar on Atlantic Avenue. His Gimlet is infused with ginger-lime cordial and served on the rocks."

    notes: Key to the success of the Diamond Noir is the fat-washing process that lends the drink its unexpected velvety texture. Eric Simmons takes a milk punch–inspired approach by filtering the entire cocktail—bourbon, yuzu juice, lemon juice and Demerara syrup—through heavy cream. The final product is then topped with a cabernet float, yielding a New York Sour–adjacent cocktail that feels right at home against a menu of pasta and Italian wine. As Simmons explains, “It has all the [elements of] the restaurant tied into one drink.”
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces overproof bourbon
    - 1/2 ounce yuzu juice
    - 1/2 ounce lemon juice

    - 1/4 ounce amontillado sherry
    - 4 ounces heavy cream
    - cabernet, to float
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients, except for the wine, and freeze for one hour.
    - Strain the mixture through a coffee filter until clarified.
    - In a mixing glass, stir the clarified mixture with ice until properly diluted.

    - 375 milliliters (½ bottle) Velvet Falernum
    - 100 milliliters lime juice
    - 50 milliliters water
    - 4 dashes Angostura Bitters
    - 4 ounces half and half
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients, except the half and half, in an 8 quart container.
    - In a separate 8 quart container, add half and half.
    - Pour the cocktail mixture (the first container) over the half and half and let sit for 30 minutes. You should see the punch curdle, this is a good thing. Line a fine mesh strainer with a damp cloth napkin or cheese cloth and place strainer over a deli container and slowly pour about 8 ounces of the mixture through the cloth. The first liquid coming through will be a bit hazy so move the strainer to another container and continue to let the mixture slowly collect into the container. Continue to pour more of the mixture through the strainer. It will yield around 2 deli containers.
    - Place punch in refrigerator and pour 3 to 4 ounces over a big ice cube whenever you like.

    notes: “I wanted to create a cocktail that kind of encapsulates the Filipino American experience,” says Napier Bulanan, who translates the ubiquitous fruit punch of family gatherings into cocktail form. A base of lambanog, a distilled palm spirit, is bolstered by aquavit, sweetened with lychee syrup and given a tart kick from fresh lime juice. The whole mixture is then clarified, milk punch–style, using coconut milk.  Serves 10.
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 15 ounces lambanog, preferably Infanta
    - 10 ounces Aquavit, preferably Ahus
    - 7 1/2 ounces lychee syrup (see Editor’s Note)
    - 5 ounces lime juice
    - 9 ounces full-fat coconut milk
    - "Garnish: a spritz of pinipig tincture and an orchid"
    steps:
    - Combine the first four ingredients in a large container to create a cocktail mixture.
    - Pour the coconut milk into a separate large container, then add the cocktail mixture. Stir the mixture and let rest for 30 minutes.
    - Line a large chinois with a clean kitchen napkin, and set it inside a large container. Slowly pour the mixture through the chinois. (You may have to pour it in batches, because the straining process takes time.) Pour the clarified cocktail into a reusable bottle and refrigerate.
    - When ready to serve, pour 3 ounces of the mixture into a mixing glass with ice, and strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.
    - Garnish with a spritz of pinipig tincture and an orchid.

    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/pina-colada-milk-punch/
    notes: How do you take a drink whose essence relies on both a beach and a blender and make it the sort of drink you’d sip near the fire? The Piña Colada so singularly symbolizes summer it seems an almost impossible feat to make it winter appropriate. Almost. This here Piña Colada Milk Punch maintains the essence of the drink’s tropical spirit with coconut water, pineapple juice, rum (and velvet falernum for extra credit), but it’s transformed by adding scalded milk, clarifying the mixture with a cheese cloth and then ladling it, punch-style, on the rocks. Serves 8-10.
    ingredients:
    - 14 ounces aged rum, preferably Plantation 5-Year
    - 8 ounces coconut water
    - 4 ounces velvet falernum
    - 1 ounce demerara syrup (1:1, sugar:water)
    - 4 ounces pineapple juice
    - 3 ounces lime juice
    - 6 ounces milk
    - "Garnish: pineapple slice, maraschino cherry"
    steps:
    - Pour the rum, coconut water, Velvet falernum, pineapple juice, lime juice, and demerara syrup into a heatsafe mixing bowl.
    - Over medium-low heat, heat the milk in a saucepan, stirring continuously until the milk begins to bubble around the edges (taking care not to let it boil).
    - Add the milk to the mixing bowl, stir until it begins to coagulate, and let the mixture sit for 15 minutes.
    - Strain through a cheesecloth or coffee filter until the mixture is clarified.
    - Ladle into cups over ice, and garnish with a cherry, pineapple slice, or both.

  - name: Smooth as Butter
    author: Daniel Villa
    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/smooth-as-butter/
    notes: A milk-washed riff on a Vieux Carré—“we swapped every ingredient, except Bénédictine,” Daniel Villa says—this drink uses toasted powdered milk to yield a silky cocktail that tastes “as though it was simultaneously milk-punched and brown-butter fat-washed.” The sunken raisin garnish is a bonus. “It’s almost a rum raisin cure in the drink,” he says. “By the time you’re done, they’re delicious, and you can enjoy them at the end as a snack.” Yields one 750ml bottle, or about eight 3-ounce servings.
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 8 ounces rehydrated toasted whole milk (see Editor’s Note)
    - 9 ounces reposado tequila, preferably El Tesoro
    - 6 ounces amontillado sherry
    - 3 ounces Pedro Ximénez sherry
    - 2 ounces mezcal, preferably Ilegal Joven
    - 1 1/2 ounces Bénédictine
    - 1 1/2 ounces Cynar
    - 1/2 teaspoon bitters (Villa prefers Crude Cardamom & Caramelized Raisin bitters, a limited-edition bottling, but says an equal amount of any style of bitters will work)
    steps:
    - Pour the rehydrated milk into a large mixing cup or Cambro.
    - In a second container, add the remaining ingredients, and stir to combine. Add the batched cocktail into the container with the rehydrated milk. Give it a gentle stir, and let it sit for about 10 minutes, during which it should curdle.
    - Pour the cocktail mixture through a fine-mesh sieve (a chinois strainer lined with a moistened linen towel or a micron bag/Superbag will also work) into a clean container. The resulting liquid should be slightly cloudy.
    - Pour the cocktail mixture a second time through the same sieve (including through the curds in the sieve) into a clean container. The resulting liquid should be fairly clear.
    - Funnel into a bottle and cap. Keeps, indefinitely, at room temperature.
    - To serve, pour 3 ounces over big ice, and stir to chill.
    - Garnish with raisins, which should sink to the bottom of the glass.

    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/fog-lights-milk-punch/
    notes: At Boston’s Eastern Standard, bar manager Diego Peña takes inspiration from a London Fog (essentially an Earl Grey tea latte) in this wintry milk punch. It calls for a warming blend of bourbon, brandy and rum alongside Earl Grey syrup. Yields 3 quarts.
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 2 cups bourbon
    - 1 cup brandy
    - 3/4 cup Jamaican rum
    - "1 3/4 cup Earl Grey syrup (1:1 earl grey tea:granulated sugar)"
    - 1 3/4 cup lemon juice
    - 1 2/3 cup whole milk
    - 3/4 cup half and half
    - Zest of one lemon (optional)
    - 1 dash vanilla extract (optional)
    - "Garnish: grated nutmeg"
    steps:
    - Add all ingredients, except milk and half and half (plus lemon and vanilla, if using), to a nonreactive container.
    - Combine the milk, half and half, lemon zest and vanilla over in a pot over the stove and heat to 180ºF.
    - Add milk to the nonreactive container and allow it to rest for approximately 3 minutes.
    - In a clean container, place a mesh strainer with a single thin layer of cheesecloth or coffee filter on top. Start the straining process by allowing the punch to pass through. Do not remove the curds—they help with the clarification. When you notice the rate of liquid passing through has slowed down, transfer the curd-filled strainer into a clean container.
    - Add the contents from the other container to the top of the strainer and slowly top of until its completely passed through. It takes some time depending on the batch.
    - Serve in a rocks glass over a large ice cube.
    - Garnish with grated nutmeg.

    url: https://punchdrink.com/recipes/jim-kearnss-alaska/
    notes: "Jim Kearns describes this drink as perfect for early autumn. “A Martini is a bright, summery drink,” he explains. By comparison, “an Alaska’s got that saffron-honey quality from the yellow Chartreuse, and that’s bolstered by the softness of the Old Tom gin,” a lightly sweetened style. Taken together, it’s a Martini-style drink with less bite and a little more roundness. In addition, Kearns readily admits that the 2 1/4 measure of gin is “a little funky,” so he offers this nifty trick: fill a 3/4-ounce jigger three times with gin, which adds up to 2 1/4 total. That same 3/4-ounce jigger can then be used to measure the yellow Chartreuse. “You don’t even have to switch jiggers!”"
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 2 1/4 oz Hayman's Old Tom gin

    notes: The Fourth Regiment, first recorded in the 1880s, was part of an explosion of Manhattan-like cocktails featuring the triumvirate of whiskey, vermouth and bitters. This one was an outlier because of the inclusion of celery bitters, in addition to Peychaud’s and orange versions. At the Austin bar DrinkWell, the Fourth Regiment is made with bonded rye, a light and herbal vermouth, Peychaud’s bitters and celery shrub, which bar manager Caer Maiko says makes it an ideal warm-weather Manhattan that delivers pleasing savory notes.

Garret Richard’s take on the banana-and-chocolate tropical dessert drink calls on a homemade liqueur made with banana schnapps, layers of chocolate, a small measure of rum and a nutmeg garnish. The whole thing gets flash-blended and served over crushed ice, which Richard says lightens the texture while also lengthening the drink’s life.

    notes: At Atomix, bar manager Marc Rodriguez insists on crafting most of the nonspirit components of the Korean restaurant’s cocktails in-house, from Sichuan peppercorn tincture to kelp syrup and house-fermented elixirs. In this drink, an unconventional cocktail ingredient—butternut squash—drives the flavor alongside curry leaf–infused oat milk, two types of citrus, acidified syrup and both gin and rye.
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 1 ounce butternut squash juice
    - 1 ounce rye, preferably Redemption Rye
    - 1/2 ounce curry leaf–infused oat milk (see Editor’s Note)
    - 1/2 ounce lactic acid simple syrup (see Editor’s Note)
    - 1/2 ounce rich cane syrup (2:1, turbinado sugar to water)
    - 1/2 ounce gin, preferably Isolation Proof
    - 1/4 ounce lemon juice
    - 1/4 ounce lime juice
    - 6 drops saline solution (4:1, water to salt)
    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake until chilled.
    - Strain into a coupe or coupette.

    notes: “Gin & Tonics, on the surface, are not attention-grabbing,” says Kim Vo. “But I love to play around with drinks that people know and … find ways to improve on that experience.” Green tea brings an earthy, grassy quality to the expected gin botanicals, peach schnapps adds fruit flavor without tilting the axis of the drink too sweet, and Becherovka provides an underlying spiced quality for a layered take on the G&T. “This particular cocktail reads like a boozy, fruity green tea, but it’s actually semi-dry,” explains Vo. “I really enjoy subverting people’s expectations on how they think a cocktail will drink.”
    year:

    notes: This Kalimotxo-inspired riff takes the classic Spanish combination of red wine and Coke in a new direction with the addition of Fernet-Branca and the bitter vermouth Punt e Mes along with a housemade cola syrup. Dow and Marrone tried a number of different amari before realizing that the missing element was Fernet-Branca all along. “Something was missing. That was when the light bulb went off, ‘Let's just try Fernet-Branca,'” says Dow.

    notes: Ned King’s admiration for the New York Sour started with its enticing appearance, but he’s gained an appreciation for its effect on his guests, too. Because it’s a variation on the classic Whiskey Sour, King says it provides his customers with a stepping stone to the more complex drinks on his bar’s menu. When building his version, he begins with a sturdy base of 100-proof rye, lemon juice, and 2:1 cane sugar syrup. For the float, he uses a Spanish red, Pedro Gonzalez Mittelbrunn Castilla y León—its “currant-raisin-spice character” complements the rye whiskey, King notes—being sure not to exceed his ideal measure of a half-ounce of wine.
    year:
    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces 100-proof rye, preferably Rittenhouse
    - 1 ounce lemon juice
    - "1/2 ounce rich cane sugar syrup (2:1, cane sugar: hot water)"
    - 1/2 ounce dry red wine, preferably preferably Pedro Gonzalez Mittelbrunn Castilla y León
    steps:
    - Combine the rye, lemon juice and syrup in a cocktail shaker.
    - Add ice (preferably two 2-by-2-inch cubes, cracked) and shake vigorously until chilled.
    - Strain into a double rocks glass over a big cube, and float wine on top.

    notes: “Mezcal was always seen as a smoke bomb and a really aggressive flavor,” says Mary Palac, “and every time you see it in a drink it’s usually in a spicy Margarita; I wanted to try something a little more delicate.” Inspired by Dick Bradsell’s modern classic, the Bramble, Palac achieves a similarly craveable combination of agave spirit, lemon juice and pineapple gum syrup. It’s topped with a float of violet liqueur, which gives it the gunmetal-gray appearance that inspired the name. “I remember smelling the mezcal and thinking immediately of flowers, so I tried it with the violet [liqueur],” she says.

This has the effect of “sinking” the lemon to the bottom of the glass. “You’re getting little bits of just lemon juice in each sip,” explains Jelani Johnson, which helps balance the effect of the robust pineapple and maple-flavored syrup.

Her Rum to the Jungle calls on a housemade cinnamon oat syrup in place of orgeat as well as Clairin and banana liqueur, an oddball addition that manages to make this spin even more tropical than the original.

It’s a combination that New York bartender Jeremy Oertel uses in his playfully-titled “Artichoke Hold” at Brooklyn cocktail bar Donna. “This cocktail is actually a play on a play,” he says. “I did a cocktail called the Bitter Mai Tai, and this is its relative.” The warm funk of Smith & Cross creates a heavy base for the bittersweet co-mingling of amaro and elderflower.

    notes: According to Cub and Dandelyan bartender Ryan Chetiyawardana, it’s always best to begin making at-home infusions with low-ABV bases. While traditional infusion methods (i.e. adding your ingredients to liquid and letting it sit in a cool, dry place) will take longer, using an iSi to “charge” the infusion is as fast as it gets. This infusion of fino sherry turns the wine into a ready-to-drink cocktail—just add ice. Serves 4.

    ingredients: 
    - 2 1/2 cups fino sherry
    - 3 fresh cherries, pitted
    - 2 sprigs mint
    - 1 sprig basil
    - 3 dried apricots
    - peel of one whole lemon
    - half of one spit vanilla pod

    notes: At Jalao, a Washington Heights, New York, branch of the iconic Santo Domingo restaurant, housemade mamajuana—a mix of rum, wine, honey and botanicals—stars in the bar’s Mamajuana Manhattan. The making of the mamajuana itself requires steeping a proprietary blend of bark and spices for three months “to eliminate some of the bitterness of the wood,” according to bartender Jordy Castillo. That bitter liquid is disposed of and replaced with a fresh round of ingredients added to a 1-liter bottle, including a touch more honey, wine and white rum that then rests for another three weeks before being put to use in this Manhattan variation, which also calls on a small measure of Frangelico and amaretto to bolster the spiced notes. The seasoned wood can be reused several times, according to Castillo.

    ingredients: 
    - 2 ounces mamajuana (see Editor’s Note)
