    glassware: double rocks
    ingredients:
    - 4 dashes Angostura bitters
    - ½ ounce grenadine
    - ¼ ounce Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur
    - ¾ ounce Cocchi Americano
    - ¾ ounce Averna
    - 1½ ounces Plantation Stiggins' Fancy Pineapple Rum
    - "Garnish: lemon twist, edible flower"
    steps: 
    - Combine the bitters, grenadine, maraschino liqueur, Cocchi Americano, Averna, and rum over a large ice cube in a double old-fashioned glass. 
    - Stir gently to incorporate the ingredients. 
    - Garnish with the lemon twist and the edible flower.
    - At Canlis, MacWilliams keeps the Averna and Cocchi Americano chilled in a refrigerator. He builds the drink over a single cube rather than chilling the glass in order to maintain the potency of flavors. In addition, even if the Canlis guest doesn’t notice, he’s drawn to the visual appeal of the liquids of varying colors and viscosity cascading over the sides of the large ice cube.
