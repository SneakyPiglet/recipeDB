#The Classic Negronis
  - name: Classic 1:1:1 Negroni
    author: 
    notes: "I prefer juniper-heavy gins in my Negronis, hence Beefeater, G’Vine Nouaison, and Tanqueray lead the charge into my glass—and I tend to pour heavy when adding the gin, too. Vermouth-wise, I’m still a sucker for Noilly Prat sweet vermouth, finding it to be lush, round, and fruity, with none of the unwanted spice notes that are appearing in some of today’s newer bottlings. Yes, Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth, I’m talking about you! Feel free to play with the ratios in this formula and make the drink your own. Remember, one of the cardinal rules when it comes to cocktail recipes: Nothing Is Written in Stone."
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce gin
    - 1 ounce sweet vermouth
    - 1 ounces Campari
    - "Garnish: 1 Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients with ice in a double old-fashioned glass. Garnish with the orange twist.

    notes: Look here for the fabulous floral notes that Amaro Cora brings to this party in a glass. You’ll likely find hints of orange zest and cinnamon, too.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Amaro Cora
    - 1½ ounces Campari
    - "Garnish: 1 Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Stir the amaro and Campari with ice in an old-fashioned glass. Garnish with the orange twist.

    notes: Martini Rosso is a great sweet vermouth, with a style that’s lighter than the heavy berry notes found in, say, Noilly Prat. As such, it’s a perfect sister for Campari, since each allows the other to tango in her own style, never bumping into each other and always keeping the same beat.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Martini Rosso vermouth
    - 1½ ounces Campari
    - "Garnish: 1 Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Stir the vermouth and Campari with ice in an old-fashioned glass. Garnish with the orange twist.

    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Campari
    - 1½ ounces sweet vermouth
    - 2 ounces club soda
    - "Garnish: 1 Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Pour the ingredients, in the order above, into an ice-filled highball glass. Garnish with the orange twist.

    author: 
    notes: The house specialty at the legendary Bar Basso in Milan is the Negroni Sbagliato, which translates as “wrong” or “mistaken” Negroni—a fitting name for a cocktail born from a happy mistake. When making a Negroni in the late 1980s, a bartender grabbed a bottle of spumante instead of gin. The drink was an instant hit, and it soon became the bar’s signature cocktail.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounces sweet vermouth
    - 1 ounces Campari
    - 1 ounces Prosecco or other sparkling wine
    - "Garnish: 1 orange slice"
    steps:
    - Stir the vermouth and Campari with ice in an old-fashioned glass. Pour in the Prosecco and stir again. Garnish with the orange slice.

  - name: My Old Pal (1992 Version)
    author: 
    notes: "According to Scotsman Adam Elmegirab, creator of Dr. Adam Elmegirab’s Bitters, “The Old Pal, or ‘My Old Pal,’ first shows up in the 1922 edition of Harry’s ABC of Cocktails. But oddly, in 1927, Arthur Moss credits the drink to one ‘Sparrow’ Robertson, sporting editor of the New York Tribune, in the appendix of Harry McElhone’s Barflies and Cocktails.” Not solely due to its cloudy origins, this is one of those cocktail recipes that drives so-called experts absolutely mad. Most people will tell you that the Old Pal is made with Campari, dry vermouth, and rye whiskey—sort of a rye Negroni. But Adam’s research complicates things a bit. He notes that a conflicting recipe appears in the 1927 book: “I remember way back in 1878, on the thirtieth of February to be exact, when the writer was discussing the subject with my old pal ‘Sparrow’ Robertson and he said to yours truly, ‘Get away with that stuff, my old pal, here’s the drink I invented when I fired the pistol the first time at the Powderhall foot races and you can’t go wrong if you put a bet down on ⅓ Canadian Club, ⅓ Eyetalian Vermouth, and ⅓ Campari,’ and then he told the writer that he would dedicate this cocktail to me, and call it, My Old Pal.” There’s no denying that My Old Pal has a Negroni-style template, but if Sparrow Robertson really did invent this drink in 1878, then the My Old Pal predates the Negroni by over forty years. Interesting trivia, if nothing else. Now, here’s where the modern-day expert’s feathers will get ruffled: the 1927 book calls for “Eyetalian Vermouth,” meaning sweet vermouth. Whatever type of vermouth you use, this cocktail works best with a good straight rye; try using Michter’s, Rittenhouse 100, or Sazerac."
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces straight Rye whiskey
    - 1 ounce Campari
    - 1 ounce dry vermouth
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients with ice in a mixing glass, then strain into a chilled champagne flute.

  - name: Boulevardier
    author: 
    notes: "Harry McElhone is such a rabble-rouser. In his 1927 book Barflies and Cocktails, he proclaims, “Now is the time for all good barflies to come to the aid of the party, since Erskinne (sic) Gwynne crashed in with his Boulevardier cocktail: ⅓ Campari, ⅓ Italian vermouth, ⅓ Bourbon whiskey.” His Boulevardier—like his My Old Pal!—calls for sweet vermouth. Cocktail purists will probably try to tell you that the Old Pal has to be made with dry vermouth and that the Boulevardier has to be made with sweet vermouth. I say pour me a drink and let’s move on. Actually, let’s pause for a moment to reflect upon the Boulevardier. The name is a nod to a Parisian magazine along the lines of the New Yorker. The Erksine McElhone speaks of was the son of Edward Erskine and Helen Steele Gwynne, and his great-uncle was Cornelius Vanderbilt. Erskine was a wealthy man, as one might imagine. Erskine’s sister, Alice “Kiki” Gwynne, was a notorious drug addict, often referred to as “the girl with the silver syringe,” and one of her three children was thought to have been fathered by Prince George, Duke of Kent, one of King George V of England’s sons. The Boulevardier magazine began publication in 1927 (the same year in which Barflies and Cocktails hit the shelves), and while lofty writers such as Ernest Hemingway and Noel Coward were contributing to its pages, the proud publisher undoubtedly quaffed quality cocktails in the City of Lights."
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce bourbon
    - 1 ounce sweet vermouth
    - 1 ounce Campari
    - "Garnish: 1 orange slice, lemon twist, or cherry"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients long and well with ice in a mixing glass, then strain into a cocktail glass. Garnish as desired.

#The New Negronis
  - name: White Negroni
    author: Eric Alperin
    notes: "Eric didn’t claim to have created this variation, and I’m told by Jim Meehan (owner of the New York City bar PDT) that it was English bartending legend Wayne Collins who first came up with the basic formula. Sorry, Wayne—I found this out at the very last minute. Eric’s tale of first serving this drink is worth telling, though: “When we opened the Varnish, we couldn’t get Suze… so my lovely French mother was suitcase importing it for us. The best was when I got a shipment and the bottles were wrapped in my old socks and underwear which I’d left at home as a young man heading out on his own. Thanks, Mom…”"
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Plymouth gin
    - ¾ ounce Dolin dry vermouth
    - ¾ ounce Suze
    - "Garnish: 1 grapefruit twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients with ice in a double old-fashioned glass. Garnish with the grapefruit twist.

  - name: White Negroni With Campari Caviar
    author: Brian Felley & Mo Hodges
    notes: Here’s another White Negroni variation, this one from bartenders at the sadly shuttered San Francisco bar Big. Making the Campari Caviar involves some black-belt bartending moves, but the result is a sight to behold.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces gin
    - ½ ounce Dolin dry vermouth
    - ½ ounce Salers Gentiane aperitif
    - 2 dashes orange bitters
    - "Garnish: Campari Caviar secured in a grapefruit twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients with ice in a mixing glass, then strain into a chilled rocks glass. Form the grapefruit twist into a cone shape, secure with a cocktail pick, then fill with a spoonful of Campari Caviar. Position the cone on the side of the glass and serve.

    notes: This is a sort of marriage between a French 75 (a classic drink that combines gin, citrus, and champagne) and a Negroni. Nice touch, Phil. It’s almost like you know what you’re doing…
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounces Plymouth gin
    - ¼ ounces Campari
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce simple syrup (1:1 sugar:water)
    - Champagne
    - "Garnish: 1 grapefruit twist"
    steps:
    - Shake the gin, Campari, lemon juice, and simple syrup with ice, then strain into a chilled champagne flute. Top with champagne. Squeeze the grapefruit twist over the drink, then discard.

    author: Grace Roth
    notes: This cocktail riffs on the beloved formula of the ice cream float, but instead of root beer we get a boozy cocktail, and instead of cloying vanilla ice cream we get grown-up lemon sorbet. Grace says, “The bittersweet bite of the Campari is mellowed by the savory sweetness from the rosemary syrup, and topping it with a scoop of lemon sorbet not only keeps your cocktail cold (eliminating the need for ice), but also adds dimension to the flavor as it melts.”
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce gin
    - 1 ounce Campari
    - 1 ounce fresh grapefruit juice
    - 1 tablespoon Rosemary Simple Syrup
    - Club soda
    - 1 scoop lemon sorbet
    - "Garnish: 1 rosemary sprig and 1 grapefruit twist"
    steps:
    - Shake the gin, Campari, grapefruit juice, and rosemary syrup with ice and strain into an old-fashioned glass. Top with club soda and the lemon sorbet, then garnish and serve.

    author: Jack McGarry
    notes: McGarry says, “This light, summery drink is a riff on the Lucien Gaudin, which I came up with a while back when I became aware of Combier’s Crème de Pamplemousse Rose liqueur.” Crème de Pamplemousse Rose, made with red grapefruit and neutral alcohol, has the refreshing flavor of very ripe grapefruit.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Tanqueray London Dry gin 
    - ½ ounce Dolin dry vermouth
    - ½ ounce Campari
    - ½ ounce Combier Crème de Pamplemousse Rosé Liqueur 
    - 2 dashes Regans’ Orange Bitters No. 6
    - "Garnish: 1 grapefruit twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients with ice in a mixing glass, then strain into a chilled champagne coupe. Squeeze the grapefruit twist over the drink, then discard the twist and serve naked. (I’m not sure whether Jack is naked when he serves this, or if he is perhaps referring to the fact that the twist never makes it into the glass. I don’t really want to find out…)

  - name: Bottecchia
    author: Kevin Burke
    notes: Burke says, “When we created the Bottecchia cocktail, we wanted it to be a Negroni variation, but in the spirit of Spinal Tap we wanted to turn it up to 11. Fernet-Branca replaced the gin, and Cynar was swapped in for the sweet vermouth. The salt tempers the bitterness of the amaro and adds a distinct savory element. We named the drink after Ottavio Bottecchia, a young professional cyclist who won the Tour de France in 1924 and wore the yellow jersey for the entire race (fifteen consecutive days). His life was cut short when he was found dead in 1927 of unknown causes. He was a known Socialist, and his politics put him in unpopular company.”
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Fernet-Branca

    - Small pinch of Kosher salt
    - "Garnish: 1 fat grapefruit twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients in a mixing glass without ice until the salt is dissolved. Add ice and stir, then strain into a chilled coupe. Squeeze the grapefruit twist over the drink, then discard.

    author: Frederic Yarm
    notes: "Fred, who is a concept cocktailian, explained this drink’s origins thusly: “Ever since John Gertsen, who was at No. 9 Park in Boston at the time, told me about his intrigue with the Knickebein, Leo Engel’s nineteenth-century pousse-café with an unbroken egg yolk in the middle, I have taken to the drink as a good rite of passage. With the autumnal leaf change coming on, I was thinking about red and yellow drinks, and the vision of a strange merger of a Negroni and a Knickebein occurred. The idea of changing around Leo’s recipe was spawned a while ago from the fact that his version’s liqueur choices don’t hold up to the modern palate, but the Negroni seemed fitting for the fall color theme. I was quite pleased with the results.”"
    ingredients:
    - ½ ounce sweet vermouth
    - ½ ounce Campari
    - 1 small or medium egg, separated, with the yolk unbroken
    - ½ ounce gin
    - "Garnish: 1 dash Regans’ Orange Bitters No. 6"
    steps:
    - Stir the vermouth and Campari together in a 2-ounce sherry glass. Gently layer the unbroken egg yolk on top, then carefully layer the gin atop the yolk. Beat the egg white until stiff with a whisk or in a cobbler shaker with a balled-up Hawthorne spring, then cover the gin layer with the egg white. Garnish with the bitters.

    author: Ludovic Miazga
    notes: "Ludovic provided the following backstory for this elegant, orange-scented libation: “The French Negroni is a twist on my favorite aperitif cocktail. Instead of using gin, I use Grey Goose L’Orange (inspired by the garnish of a classic Negroni), along with Noilly Prat sweet vermouth and Amer Picon (a great substitute for Campari). I serve it in a rocks glass, but the original was created in France, in Cognac (the home of Grey Goose), and was prepared in a cognac snifter and garnished with a wedge of blood orange. I sometimes like to use a grapefruit twist for enhanced citrus fragrance. In terms of measurements, this is my favorite recipe, but of course it can be made with equal parts of all three spirits or adjusted depending on whether the drinker wishes it to be more bitter, sweet, orangey, and so on.”"
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Grey Goose L’orange Vodka
    - ⅔ ounce Amer Picon
    - ⅚ ounce (about 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons) Noilly Prat sweet vermouth

I give it a good long stir (20 seconds or so) and then decant from about 24 inches above the cocktail glass to aerate.”"

    notes: "This Negroni variation has literary origins, as Jill explains: “I created this drink, a twist on both the Negroni and the Dog’s Nose cocktail, which is mentioned in Charles Dickens’s Pickwick Papers, as a tribute to Mr. Walker, the character in the Pickwick Papers who lost the use of his right hand after drinking too many Dog’s Noses. He became a member of the Brick Lane Temperance Society in East London, so with that in mind, this is my cockney version of the Negroni (Dog and Pony in rhyming slang). I like to think that if Walker had ever changed his mind about the whole Temperance thing and Campari had been around back then, he might have ordered this down at his local gin palace.”"

    author: Julie Reiner
    notes: According to Julie, this Negroni was created on a whim a while ago when she was working at Lani Kai, her New York tiki club that has since closed. Apparently mixology consultant Toby Maloney dropped in to see Julie, and he asked her to make him whatever she liked. This drink became her house Negroni—and it was one of the most popular boozy drinks on the menu. To make the Demerara syrup, simply combine equal parts, by volume, of water and Demerara sugar; heat and stir until the sugar dissolves and allow it to cool to room temperature. Keep in the refrigerator.

    author: Colin Peter Field
    notes: Before I turn you over to Colin, I should tell you that the recipe below was created by a bartender in Germany whose name we don’t know, and that the name of this drink, Negroni Hors Pair (the Peerless Negroni), is something I conjured up after reading Colin’s account below. Okay, over to Colin. “I was recently judging a marvelous competition sponsored by Campari in Munich. Mauro Mahjoub from Mauro’s Negroni Club was the host, along with the incredible Charles Schumann, who was a host one evening. Mahjoub’s new bar is very large, and his bartenders are loaded with professionalism. The atmosphere was stupendous. “One young lady, who hardly trembled as she displayed her talent hors pair [peerless talent] completely seduced me with her Negroni recipe. I wish that I trembled so little in competitions, and I wish that I had invented this cocktail. I also wish that I had written down her name, but I hope that she reads this and spontaneously manifests herself to us. She didn’t win the competition, but her cocktail was the one that inspired me the most. I was enthralled by the taste and its mysterious darkness, which seems to befit Comte Negroni’s cocktail… The young woman saw how much I loved her cocktail and offered me a bottle of 15-year-old balsamic vinegar. I’m almost sure that I will never see her again, but I will always remember the few minutes that I passed with her and her cocktail. For that matter, I don’t even remember the name of the cocktail, perhaps because this was the real Negroni.”

    - 1 ounce Beefeater 24 London Dry gin

Buñuel’s producer Serge Silberman gave the recipe to Buñuel biographer John Baxter in the 1990s, and I tweaked it slightly to create this version.”"

I measured, mixed, and stirred it, then gave it a taste and realized that something was different—wonderfully different. This is one of those drinks with a combination of spirits that creates a whole new flavor.”"

    author: Marcos Tello
    notes: This cocktail, created by the fabulous Marcos Tello of Los Angeles, was brought to this book courtesy of Ted Munat, author of Left Coast Libations. The drink uses cachaça, a sugar-based Brazilian spirit that can be thought of as a style of rum, but Ted notes that “this isn’t your stereotypical muddled fruit and lime juice cachaça drink. The Alexandria Hotel Cocktail first saw light of day in 2009, when Marcos helped to put together the Los Angeles Sub-District Cocktail Competition. His idea was to emulate New York City, which early on had the Manhattan, Bronx, and Brooklyn cocktails, then later the Red Hook, Greenpoint, Little Italy, Bensonhurst, and so on. Marcos even went so far as to emulate the style of these signature New York City drinks, making it a rule of the competition that the drinks must be stirred cocktails made using a base spirit, modifying vermouth, liqueur or a sweetening agent, and some type of bitters, without citrus, homemade ingredients, or extremely obscure, hard-to-find ingredients.” The old Alexandria Hotel was an iconic Los Angeles spot and, according to Tello, “a magnet for old, glamorous Hollywood. Even the carpet was called ‘the million dollar carpet,’ because it was said that a million dollars in business was done there every day.”
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce silver cachaça
    - 1 ounce Campari
    - ½ ounce Mathilde Peach Liqueur
    - 1 dash Fee Brothers West Indian Orange bitters
    - 1 dash Regans’ Orange Bitters No. 6

    author: Max la Rocca
    notes: "Max, one of my favorite bartenders—we go back a few years at this point—told me the following about his Negroni variation: “The drink I made for this precious little book is called Camillo in Xela, Xela being the indigenous name for Quetzaltenango, the city in Guatemala where the House of Zacapa is located. The rum used in this recipe is aged at over 7,500 feet in elevation. Of course you all know who Camillo is…“ Being from Italy, where coffee is a very important element of the culture, I was curious to play with the toasted flavor of this amazing ingredient. It echoes the bitterness of the Campari and complements the complexity of the Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth and the beautiful hints of vanilla, almond, and chocolate of the Zacapa 23. The coffee is also fitting, given that the Zacapa comes from Guatemala, one of the world’s leading producers of coffee.”"
    ingredients:
    - 8 coffee beans
    - 1 ounce Zacapa 23-Year rum
    - ¾ ounce Carpano Antica Formula sweet vermouth
    - ½ ounce Campari
    - "Garnish: 1 long Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Flame the coffee beans with a blowtorch. Put 5 of them in a mixing glass and crush them with the flat end of a barspoon. Add the remaining ingredients and stir without ice for 30 seconds. Add ice, stir, then double strain into a double old-fashioned glass filled with ice. Garnish with the Orange twist and the 3 remaining coffee beans.

Hmm…, I thought. Watch the measurements on this one—Perfecto Amor can be a dominant soul. And don’t overdo the Angostura! By the way, if you can’t find Perfecto Amor in your neck of the woods, you can use amontillado sherry in its stead.

#The Large-Format Negronis
  - name: Bottle-Aged and Vint-Aged Negronis
    author: Tony Conigliaro
    notes: Makes 76 ounces; serves about 25. Tony is one of the world’s preeminent bartenders, and the man behind 69 Colebrooke Row—a fantastic, wildly inventive bar in London’s Islington neighborhood. Tony is known for doing weird and wonderful things with cocktails—including using tools and techniques from molecular gastronomy, like Rotavapors and sous-vide machines, to create custom ingredients. But for all his technological wizardry, Tony still loves a good classic. He says, “I love Negronis because to me they are the signifier for aperitivo. As an Italian, I so appreciate that as a cultural concept. The aperitivo says, Work is over. It’s time to open your palate and start to enjoy your night! But being me, I couldn’t just let the Negroni be a Negroni! I wanted to see what else I could do with it—what other directions it could take. “I first started aging Negronis five years ago. We had great success with Manhattans and wanted to see what else we could use the process with. When you age a cocktail, it mellows considerably; the different spirits combine on a molecular level and come together beautifully. We started flash-fusing ingredients for the Negroni in the sous-vide to see if we could approximate the effect of aging without the time commitment. We experimented with periods between one and twenty-four hours. “We found that the longer you cooked it, the more it tasted like it had been aged in the bottle for a long time. We started serving these ‘vint-aged’ Negronis at the bar, and they were a great hit. It was fantastic to discover something that created the effect of aging without having to stick a lot of bottles in the cellar! ”Few people have access to sous-vide machines, and I’m not one of the few, so instead of flash-fusing (combining the three ingredients, vacuum-sealing them in a bag, and dropping it into a sous-vide machine for a certain amount of time), I allow my vint-aged Negronis to mature slowly, in bottles. It takes longer, but you get there in the end. The bottled Negronis make great favors to take to parties. When you open and serve them—over ice in a double old-fashioned glass—be sure to have some freshly cut Orange twists handy for garnishes.
    ingredients:
    - 1 (750mL) bottle gin
    - 1 (750 mL) bottle Campari
    - 1 (750 mL) bottle sweet vermouth 
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients together in a large container. Decant into smaller bottles. (I like to reuse and relabel the original gin, vermouth, and Campari bottles.) Store out of direct sunlight for at least 1 month, at which point subtle changes in flavor should be detectable. In theory, you could age these Negronis indefinitely, but chances are you won’t. Six months of aging makes an incredible difference, and to be honest, I’ve never managed to store my Negronis any longer than that.

    notes: "Makes about 3 gallons; serves about 128. Jeffrey has been, and continues to be, a leading force in the twenty-first-century bartending and cocktailian movement. He visited Tony Conigliaro at 69 Colebrooke Row in London in 2010 and, inspired by Conigliaro’s Manhattans aged in glass vessels, he returned to Portland to try his hand at barrel-aged cocktails, which he calls “a decidedly American curiosity.” On his popular, eponymous blog, Jeffrey Morgenthaler discusses his approach: “The rub of aging cocktails in a glass bottle is that the whole premise is built upon subtlety, as we know that spirits aged in glass or steel do so at an unremarkable pace. Being from the United States, where—as everyone is aware—bigger equals better, I pondered the following question: What if you could prepare a large batch of a single, spirit-driven cocktail and age it in a used oak barrel?“ A hundred some-odd dollars in liquor later, I was nervously pouring a gallon of pre-batched rye Manhattans into a small, used oak cask whose previous contents were Madeira wine. I plugged the barrel and sat back in anxious anticipation. If the experiment was a success, I’d have a delicious cocktail to share at the bar; if it was a failure, then I’d be pouring the restaurant’s money down the floor drain. “Over the next several weeks I popped open the barrel to test my little concoction until I stumbled upon the magic mark at five to six weeks. And there it was, lying beautifully on the finish: a soft blend of oak, wine, caramel, and char. That first batch sold out in a matter of days, and I was left with a compelling need to push the process even further.” Morgenthaler’s Manhattan project was a success, and he soon moved on to Negronis: “After six weeks in the bourbon barrel, our Negroni emerged a rare beauty: the sweet vermouth so slightly oxidized, the color paler and rosier than the original, the mid-palate softly mingled with whiskey, the finish long and lingering with oak tannins. We knew we were onto something unique and immediately made plans to take the cask-aging program to the next level.” Now even home bartenders are exploring barrel aging, benefiting from the fact that it’s quite easy to order used (or new) oak barrels online. One reliable source for used whiskey barrels is the online store at Tuthilltown Spirits in New York. They sell 3-gallon charred oak barrels that were previously used for whiskey. Three gallons yields about 128 drinks—perfect for a large party, a wedding, or a particularly boozy family reunion. Morgenthaler decants his cocktails into glass vessels. However, you can also drill a hole into the side of the barrel and insert a spigot; any home brew, wine-making, or vinegar-making shop should supply spigots, and they might even drill the hole for you."
