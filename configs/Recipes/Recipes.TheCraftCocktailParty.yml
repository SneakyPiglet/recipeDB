#Summer
  #Farmer's Market
  - name: La Rosa
    notes: |+2
       You'd never think that tequila and amaro, the classic Italian digestif, would make sense together in a cocktail. Enter the strawberry, which somehow brings these strong spirits into harmony.
    glassware: martini
    ingredients:
    - 1 strawberry, hulled
    - ½ ounce simple syrup
    - 2 ounces Cabeza blanco tequila
    - 1 ounce Ramazzotti amaro
    - ¾ ounce lemon juice
    - 1½ ounces sparkling rosé wine
    - "Garnish: spiral lemon twist"
    steps:
    - In the bottom of a shaker, muddle the strawberry in the simple syrup. 
    - Add the tequila, amaro, and lemon juice and shake with ice. 
    - Double-strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a Martini glass and top with the sparkling rosé. 
    - Garnish with the lemon twist.

      Think of this drink as a Bloody Mary on the fly. Forget the canned tomato juice; here, the freshness of summer's favorite fruit is muddled directly into the drink. To make this drink in larger yields, pulse the tomatoes and basil in a food processor 5 or 6 times, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve or a piece of cheesecloth and discard the solids.
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 6 cherry tomatoes
    - 6 basil leaves
    - ½ ounce simple syrup
    - 2 ounces El Tesoro blanco tequila
    - ½ ounce Williams & Humbert medium-dry dry sherry
    - ½ ounce lemon juice
    - Pinch salt and pepper
    - "Garnish: 1 cherry tomato and 1 basil leaf"
    steps:
    - In the bottom of a shaker, muddle the tomatoes and basil in the simple syrup. 
    - Add the tequila, sherry, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and shake with ice until chilled. 
    - Double-strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a coupe glass.
    - To create the garnish, pierce a small hole in the top of the tomato and insert the stem of the basil leaf like a flag. Make a slit in the bottom of the tomato and perch the tomato on the rim of the glass.

       Sloe gin, an invention of the British, is infused with sloe berries. To bring that flavor to the fore, this drink calls for both raspberries and blackberries and is capped off by cherry-flavored maraschino liqueur.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Plymouth gin
    - ½ ounce Plymouth sloe gin
    - 1 teaspoon Luxardo maraschino liqueur
    - ¾ ounce lemon juice
    - ½ ounce berry syrup
    - Crushed ice
    - "Garnish: 2 raspberries and 1 blackberry"
    steps:
    - Shake both gins, maraschino liqueur, lemon juice, and syrup with cubed ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a rocks glass filled with crushed ice. 
    - To garnish, spear the berries on a pick and lay it across the rim of the glass.

    notes: |+2
      Hot peppers, like jalapeños and serranos, express their flavors extremely well in the presence of booze. Often too well, for my taste—it can be really difficult to balance such a powerful heat factor in a cocktail. But I love a little spice, so I've worked hard to find the middle ground, and this cocktail is it. Rather than create a syrup, I muddle jalapeño slices to limit the amount of time that the pepper is in contact with the alcohol. By doing this, I can control the spice level and ramp it up for my friends who love an extra-spicy drink. At Clover Club, we often feature a jalapeño-infused tequila, another great way to incorporate peppers into your drinks. You can infuse your own by letting peppers sit in tequila for 8 to 15 minutes, tasting along the way so you can strain out the peppers when you have achieved the spice level you desire.
    glassware: double rocks
    ingredients:
    - 10 cilantro leaves
    - 4 (1-inch) chunks fresh pineapple
    - 2 wheels (¼-inch) fresh jalapeño, or 3 for a spicier drink
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - 2 ounces Don Julio Blanco tequila
    - ¾ ounce lime juice
    - "Garnish: pineapple wedge"
    steps:
    - In the bottom of a shaker, muddle the cilantro, pineapple, and jalapeño with the simple syrup. 
    - Add the tequila and lime juice and shake with ice until chilled. 
    - Double-strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a double rocks glass filled with ice. 
    - To garnish, cut a slit through the bottom of the pineapple wedge and place it on the rim of the glass.

    - 1 raspberry
    - ¾ ounce demerara syrup
    - 1¼ ounces Flor de Caña Extra Dry 4 Year white rum

  #Fourth of July
  - name: Spread Eagle Punch
    author: David Wondrich
    notes: |+2
      This recipe comes directly from David Wondrich's Fourth of July bash. He wrote the book on punch—and I mean that literally; his book, <i>Punch</i>, gives an in-depth history of this style of drink—so there is always at least one bowl of the stuff on hand. Makes 18 servings.
    glassware: punch bowl
    ingredients:
    - Peels of 12 lemons
    - 1 cup turbinado sugar
    - 12 cups water, divided
    - 1½ (750-ml) bottles Rittenhouse rye whiskey
    - 1½ (750-ml) bottles Black Grouse blended Scotch
    - Large ice block
    - "Garnish: Lemon wheels (from 8 lemons) and nutmeg"
    steps:
    - Place the lemon peels in a large bowl. Add the sugar to the lemon peels and muddle until the sugar looks slightly moistened. Cover and let sit for an hour.
    - Bring 1 cup of the water to a boil. 
    - Pour the boiling water over the lemon peel mixture and stir until sugar has dissolved. 
    - Add the whiskeys and the remaining 11 cups water and chill. 
    - To serve, transfer the punch to a punch bowl. 
    - Right before serving, fish out the lemon peels with a slotted spoon and add the large ice block. 
    - Garnish by placing the lemon wheels in the punch and grating nutmeg over the surface.

      At the bar, we have giant ice molds to make the ice cubes that keep this punch cold, but when I do it at home, a Tupperware container works just as well. Fill a 1-quart to 2-quart container with hot water (which freezes into clearer ice) and stick it in the freezer twenty-four hours before the party. Then add the giant cube to your punch bowl right before the guests arrive; it keeps everything cold and looks beautiful. Makes 20 servings.
    glassware: punch bowl
    ingredients:
    - Peels of 4 lemons
    - ½ cup superfine sugar
    - 1 (1-liter) bottle Bombay Dry or Bombay Sapphire gin
    - 1 (750-ml) bottle Aperol
    - 12 ounces St. Germain elderflower liqueur
    - 12 ounces lemon juice
    - 12 ounces orange juice
    - 12 ounces grapefruit juice
    - Large ice block
    - 1 (750-ml) bottle sparkling rosé wine
    - "Garnish: Lemon wheels (from 2 lemons)"
    steps:
    - Place the lemon peels in a bowl with the sugar (save the lemons for juicing). Muddle the peels until the sugar looks slightly moistened, then let sit covered for at least 1 hour, or overnight.
    - In a large punch bowl, combine the gin, Aperol, St. Germain, and juices. 
    - Add the lemon peel mixture and let sit for 15 minutes. 
    - Remove the peels. 
    - Right before serving, add the ice block and rosé. 
    - Garnish the punch bowl with the lemon wheels.

    notes: |+2
      Juleps, tiny mountains of crushed ice with flags of refreshing mint leaves, are made for the height of summer. And the ice might be the most important ingredient of all; without it, the drink won't have the right water content and will be unbalanced. Adding the ice in three parts ensures that the cocktail will be just diluted enough.
    glassware: julep tin
    ingredients:
    - 8 to 10 mint leaves
    - ½ ounce grade B maple syrup
    - 2 ounces Laird's bonded apple brandy
    - Crushed ice
    - "Garnish: 2 or 3 mint sprigs"
    steps:
    - In the bottom of a julep cup, gently muddle the mint in the maple syrup, just enough to release the oils in the mint leaves. 
    - Add the brandy and fill the cup halfway with crushed ice. Stir until chilled (the cup should become frosty), then add more ice, stir again, and then pack the top with a cone of ice. 
    - Garnish with the mint sprigs placed next to the straw for maximum aromatic appeal.

      This cocktail falls into a category I like to call porch drinks (or stoop drinks, for those of us who live in Brooklyn). On a humid summer day on the East Coast, I am looking for a long drink that is really going to quench my thirst. This one does the trick.

    - 1 strawberry, hulled
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - 1½ ounces Wild Turkey 101 rye whiskey
    - ¼ ounce Bénédictine

    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 2 ounces club soda
    - "Garnish: 1 strawberry, hulled, and a spiral lemon twist"
    steps:
    - In the bottom of a shaker, muddle the strawberry in the simple syrup. 
    - Add the rye, Bénédictine, lemon juice, and bitters and shake with ice.

      The ginger syrup in this drink is the real star. It's so good, in fact, that you could leave the booze out entirely for an undeniably delicious mocktail.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 8 mint leaves
    - ¾ ounce ginger syrup
    - 2 ounces Ketel One Citroen or Tanqueray No. Ten Gin
    - ¾ ounce lemon juice

    - "Garnish: Mint sprig"
    steps:
    - In the bottom of a shaker, muddle the mint leaves with the ginger syrup. 
    - Add the vodka or gin, lemon juice, and water and shake with ice until chilled.

    notes: |+2
      Though this drink is traditionally made with vodka, the beauty of the mule is that the formula works with any spirit. Substitute dark rum, tequila, or gin for the vodka for a delicious variation on the classic. Or try it with whiskey or Scotch, swapping out the lime juice for lemon juice.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Stoli vodka
    - ¾ ounce ginger syrup
    - ¾ ounce lime juice
    - Club soda
    - "Garnish: Candied ginger and lime wheel"
    steps:
    - Shake the vodka, ginger syrup, and lime juice with ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a rocks glass filled with ice and fill to the top with club soda. 
    - To make the garnish, spear the candied ginger and the lime wheel with a toothpick and perch on the rim of the glass.

  #From Tiki to Modern Tropical
  - name: Summer Negroni

      A couple years ago, I had made an Aperol infusion for a farmers' market charity event and had some left over. When I came back to the bar after working the event, exhausted and thirsty, one of my bartenders and I took the leftover infusion and started making a “kitchen sink” cocktail—adding whatever was handy. The result was shockingly delicious—so much so that we added it to the bar menu.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 3 ounces strawberry-infused Aperol
    - 1 ounce grapefruit juice
    - ¼ ounce lemon juice
    - 1 to 3 ounces soda water
    - "Garnish: Orange twist or strawberry"
    steps:
    - In a Collins glass filled with ice, combine the infused Aperol, grapefruit juice, and lemon juice. 
    - Fill to the rim with soda water and stir once or twice to combine. 
    - Garnish with the orange twist or strawberry (or both).

      "This is one of the simplest recipes in the book and one of the first drinks people gravitate toward when I put it out at a party. Named for Hanalei (pronounced hawn-ah-lay) Bay on the north shore of Kauai, it's a great first-time infusion experiment. It does require a bit of lead time, however: The mixture must sit for at least one week for maximum flavor, so plan accordingly. Makes about 3 cups, enough for 7 drinks."
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 1 pineapple, peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch pieces
    - 1 (750-ml) bottle vodka or white rum
    - "Garnish: Pineapple wedges, 1 per serving"
    steps:
    - Place the pineapple pieces and the vodka or rum in a large nonreactive metal or glass container with a lid. 
    - Cover and let sit for one week in the refrigerator, stirring it once a day. 
    - Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, allowing the fruit to sit in the strainer for 30 minutes so as to get all the liquid. 
    - Discard the fruit and funnel the infusion back into the original bottle and label. 
    - The infusion will keep for two weeks in the refrigerator.
    - To serve, pour 3½ ounces of the pineapple infusion into a shaker and shake with ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a chilled coupe glass and garnish with a pineapple wedge.

      The swizzle is a celebration of ice. This style of drink originated in the Caribbean, shortly after ice production had made its way to the islands. By blending crushed ice, alcohol, and sugar in a glass with a swizzle stick (traditionally a forked stick made from a root), you create a delightful, refreshing grown-up slushy.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces passion fruit tea-infused rum
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - ½ ounce lime juice
    - ¼ ounce passion fruit puree (available in specialty stores or online at gourmetfoodstore.com)
    - Crushed ice
    - "Garnish:  Orchid and orange half wheel"
    steps:
    - Combine the rum, simple syrup, lime juice, and puree in a Collins glass; fill the glass a third full with crushed ice and swizzle using a swizzle stick or bar spoon. Add more crushed ice to about one inch below the lip of the glass; swizzle again in the top half of the glass. Pack with additional crushed ice and garnish with the orchid and the orange half wheel.

      My favorite tiki pirate, Brian Miller, is behind this whimsical drink. Orgeat is an almond syrup that appears in many tiki recipes, most famously the Mai Tai. It's sort of a pain to make from scratch, so I recommend buying a high-quality prepared version, like the one from Orgeat Works, which is available at orgeatworks.com.
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Appleton Estate Reserve aged rum
    - ½ ounce Busnel VSOP calvados
    - ½ ounce lemon juice
    - ½ ounce orange juice
    - ½ ounce orgeat (I recommend T'Orgeat from Orgeat Works)
    - 1 teaspoon cinnamon syrup
    - "Garnish: Lemon wheel"
    steps:
    - Shake the rum, Calvados, lemon juice, orange juice, orgeat, and cinnamon syrup with ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a cocktail glass and garnish with the lemon wheel.

    notes: |+2
      The Mai Tai is by far the most iconic drink to come out of the tiki craze. This 1944 version was created by Trader Vic at his flagship bar in Oakland, California. Recipes were kept under wraps at most tiki dens, causing bartenders elsewhere to make up their own versions upon the request of a patron. I have been served many a tropical drink under the moniker Mai Tai, and while they are usually delicious, they are usually not Mai Tais! Vic's recipe is boozy, citrusy, and strong… and not red or blue!
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Clément VSOP Martinique rum
    - 1 ounce Appleton Estate Reserve Jamaican rum

    - ¼ ounce simple syrup
    - Crushed ice
    - "Garnish: Traditionally, just a mint sprig, but I serve mine with a lime wheel and an orchid as well"
    steps:
    - Shake the rums, orange curaçao, lime juice, orgeat, and simple syrup with cubed ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a rocks glass filled with crushed ice. Garnish with the mint sprig and add the lime wheel and orchid, if using.

      Allspice is another flavor frequently encountered in the world of tropical drinks. Here, instead of going through the trouble of making an allspice syrup, I use Dale DeGroff's aromatic allspice bitters.
    glassware: wine glass
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Bacardi 8 aged rum
    - ¾ ounce pineapple juice
    - ¾ ounce lime juice
    - 1 ounce simple syrup
    - 2 dashes Dale DeGroff's Pimento bitters
    - 2 ounces sparkling wine (I recommend Moët & Chandon Impérial or Gruet Brut)
    - "Garnish: Lime wheel and pineapple leaf"
    steps:
    - Shake the rum, pineapple juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and bitters with ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a wineglass filled with ice. Top with the sparkling wine and garnish with the lime wheel and pineapple leaf in the glass.

    notes: |+2
      A tiki party wouldn't be complete without a blue drink, and the Blue Hawaii (also known as the Blue Hawaiian, depending on whom you ask) is one of my favorites. It was created in 1957 by Harry Yee, legendary head bartender at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki, when a sales representative of Dutch distiller Bols asked him to design a drink that featured their blue curaçao liqueur. This is my version of his classic.
    glassware: hurricane
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces El Dorado 3 Year white rum
    - ½ ounce blue curaçao
    - 1 ounce pineapple juice
    - ½ ounce lemon juice
    - ¼ ounce simple syrup
    - 1 teaspoon cream of coconut (I recommend Calahua or Coco Lopez)
    - Crushed ice
    - "Garnish: Orange slice and orchid"
    steps:
    - Shake the rum, curaçao, pineapple juice, lemon juice, simple syrup, and cream of coconut with 3 ice cubes until chilled. 
    - Strain into a hurricane glass filled with crushed ice. 
    - To garnish, place the orange slice on the rim of the glass and tuck the orchid into the ice at the top of the glass.

    notes: |+2
      There are few things as perfect as a Daiquiri. The three-ingredient cocktail is an exercise in simplicity. But when I have some lemongrass syrup on hand, I like to swap it in for regular simple syrup; the change is subtle but beguiling, and great for a summer evening. Take it a step farther by muddling three or four leaves of Thai basil in the shaker before adding the other ingredients.
    glassware: martini
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Banks 5 Island white rum
    - ¾ ounce lime juice
    - ¾ ounce lemongrass syrup
    - "Garnish: 1 (3-inch) piece lemongrass stalk and 1 lime wheel"
    steps:
    - Shake the rum, lime juice, and lemongrass syrup with ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a Martini glass. 
    - To garnish, spear the lime wheel with the lemongrass stalk and rest inside the glass.

  #Labor Day
  - name: Tropical White Sangria
    year: 2005
    notes: |+2
      This sangria recipe was created for the 2005 summer menu at Flatiron Lounge and tested out at my in-laws' house for one of our summer pool parties. Sangria is a fantastic drink for large parties because it tastes better when you make it the night before. The key to a great sangria is to give it time to sit, allowing the flavors to meld together. On a hot day, it is also nice to have a lower-alcohol option, and this sangria can easily be made lighter by diluting it with club soda. Makes 30 drinks.
    glassware: wine glass
    ingredients:
    - 7 very ripe mangoes, peeled, pitted, and roughly diced into 1-inch cubes
    - 10 lemongrass stalks, brittle outer layers removed, cores finely chopped
    - 5 (750-ml) bottles dry medium-bodied white wine
    - 8 ounces Rémy Martin VS Cognac
    - 4 ounces Luxardo amaretto
    - 4 ounces Pierre Ferrand Dry orange curaçao
    - 8 ounces lychee juice
    - "Garnish: 3 pints raspberries"
    steps:
    - In a large container, mix the mangoes, lemongrass, wine, Cognac, amaretto, orange curaçao, and lychee juice. 
    - Refrigerate overnight. 
    - Strain the solids the next day and transfer to a pitcher. 
    - Garnish the pitcher with a couple of the raspberries.
    - To make one serving, pour 5 ounces of the mixture into a wineglass filled with ice. Garnish with raspberries.

#Fall
  #The Classics
  - name: Old Fashioned
    notes: |+2
      "Whenever I'm at a new bar and want to get a better understanding of the bartender's style, I order this drink. The mandatory ingredients for an Old Fashioned are few—whiskey, bitters, sugar, water, and citrus—but within that formula there are so many choices to make. Does the bartender use the traditional Angostura bitters, or some other variety? Does she muddle a sugar cube into the glass, or use a simple syrup? What about the citrus: orange or lemon or both? Really, the options are endless, and any bartender worth her salt should use this drink as her calling card. My version hovers between the old school and the new: I use demerara syrup because I think it creates an ideal consistency while adding depth and flavor. For bitters, I use the classic Angostura, as well as orange. I love Bulleit rye in an Old Fashioned, and I round out the drink with both lemon and orange twists. Also, I'm a big believer that an Old Fashioned needs quite a bit of dilution, so I stir mine with ice for 25 seconds, or until the ice has fallen below the line of the liquid, then pour it over fresh ice cubes, or ideally one large cube, to serve. The size of the ice cubes really does matter for a drink like this. If the cubes are small, stir for less time. More surface area results in faster dilution."
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Bulleit rye whiskey
    - 1 teaspoon demerara syrup
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 2 dashes orange bitters (such as Regans' or Fee Brothers)
    - "Garnish: Long lemon twist and long orange twist"
    steps:
    - In a mixing glass, combine the rye, demerara syrup, and both bitters. 
    - Add ice and stir for 20 to 25 seconds, then strain into an Old Fashioned glass filled with fresh ice. 
    - Garnish with the lemon and orange twists, expressed over the surface of the glass and rim and dropped into the glass.

  - name: Manhattan
    notes: |+2
      "I first started drinking Manhattans while I was cocktail waitressing in San Francisco. Embarrassing confession: I used to add a splash of cherry juice to my glass to temper the strength of the drink—it was my gateway into the world of boozy cocktails. However, it wasn't long before I ditched the cherry juice and fell in love with the unadulterated Manhattan. Now it's probably my single favorite drink. If I could have invented any cocktail in the world, it would have been this one. My adoration for the Manhattan begins with my love for its base spirit, whiskey. This recipe is a great way to showcase different whiskeys and better understand their various profiles. Start with rye, then make one with bourbon—you'll find a remarkable difference. The finishing touch is a Luxardo cherry, which you can buy online and in specialty stores. These Italian cherries are the best I've ever had, and in my opinion, house-made versions just can't compete."
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Bulleit rye or Wild Turkey Rare Breed bourbon
    - ¾ ounce Punt e Mes

  - name: Sidecar
    notes: |+2
      This Cognac-based drink was on our first fall menu at Flatiron Lounge. I was astonished by how many people ordered it because someone they once knew (generally a grandparent) had always drunk Sidecars. Rest assured, this drink doesn't need nostalgia to hold it up. As one of the original sours (a family of cocktails that includes the Margarita and the Daiquiri), this cocktail is a crowd pleaser. I'll often make it for a holiday fete because it's one of the few dark-spirit cocktails that almost everyone can enjoy.

    notes: |+2
      I was so excited when I first came upon this classic drink, which is thought to be the precursor to the Martini. It's sweeter, thanks to the use of Old Tom gin and maraschino liqueur, but also more complex. There are quite a few Old Tom gins on the market now, but the drink can be just as delicious when made with other styles of gin, such as London dry or genever. This is my favorite recipe for the Martinez, and one that really seems to sit well with the modern palate. You will find that many cocktail bars today serve a predominantly gin-based Martinez using a London dry gin as opposed to the classic equal-parts recipe seen in the past.
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces gin (Hayman's Old Tom, Tanqueray Old Tom, Bols Genever, or Tanqueray London Dry)

Most of the recipes in this book work with various brands of spirits, but this recipe and Gin Blossom (here) were both calibrated very specifically with certain brands. I suggest you try making them as written first before swapping in other bottles."

      With the opening of Flatiron Lounge, I made a few edits to my apple Martini invention to make it more… well… Martini-like. I traded the sparkling cider for Pommeau, a French spirit made by combining apple juice with Calvados (apple brandy), and Berentzen Apple Liqueur (a German apple schnapps). This is a fun drink to experiment with. If you can find Pommeau, give it a shot; the liqueur is available online or at specialty liquor stores.

      This drink is a great reminder that cocktails should be about what you like to drink, not what someone else deems “correct.” I originally made it for a friend who loved vodka, and vodka only. More than ten years later, the recipe reads as a list of what not to do in a craft cocktail bar. Flavored vodka and an orange wedge instead of a twist? The horror! Somehow, those things didn't keep it from becoming one of our best-selling drinks at the bar back when I created it. And even though I make it with a twist now, I think it's still pretty damn tasty.
    glassware: martini
    ingredients:
    - ¼ ounce Cointreau
    - 1½ ounces Stoli Ohranj
    - 1½ ounces Lillet Blanc
    - "Garnish: Orange twist"
    steps:
    - "Rinse a cocktail glass with the Cointreau: Pour the Cointreau into the glass and swirl around to coat; discard the excess Cointreau." 
    - In a mixing glass, combine the vodka and Lillet. 
    - Fill with ice and stir until chilled, then strain into the prepared glass. 
    - Garnish with the orange twist.

      I'm often asked where my inspiration for cocktails originates. A lot of the time, it comes from a certain ingredient or spice, but sometimes it comes from a new spirit. When the Blume Marillen apricot eau-de-vie arrived at my bar, I tried it and immediately knew that it'd make a fascinating addition to a Martini. I had already been using an apricot liqueur in our house Manhattan at Clover Club, so I created this sister drink to serve as our house Martini.
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Plymouth gin
    - 1½ ounces Martini bianco vermouth
    - ¾ ounce Blume Marillen apricot eau-de-vie
    - 2 dashes orange bitters
    - "Garnish: Orange twist"
    steps:
    - In a mixing glass, combine the gin, vermouth, eau-de-vie, and bitters. 
    - Fill with ice and stir until chilled. Strain into a chilled Nick and Nora glass and garnish with the orange twist.
    - There are many variations of orange bitters on the market. In my bars we use Regans' and Fee Brothers'—one dash of each. Fees' is very light, while Regans' has dominant cardamom flavors. Together they make the perfect orange bitter.

      I can never make enough of this drink; anytime I bring it out at a party, it's gone in minutes. The same was true when we had it on the menu at Flatiron Lounge. The infusion took up too much refrigerator space to keep up with the demand!

      One thing I love about the bartending community is that it is incredibly generous. Bartenders take care of each other and are quick to support the efforts of their peers. In that vein, one of my favorite parts of our original Flatiron Lounge menus was the “guest” section, where we'd showcase drinks created by talented bartenders at other bars. Not only was it nice for them, but it also opened me and my team up to new techniques and ingredients. This drink, created by Jerri Banks, a talented bartender who was running the cocktail program at a nearby bar when we opened Flatiron Lounge, was my introduction to pomegranate molasses, which is a great cocktail ingredient. You can find it at Middle Eastern markets.
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 8 mint leaves
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - 2 ounces Junipero gin (or similar high-proof, juniper-forward gin)
    - 1 ounce lime juice
    - ¾ teaspoon pomegranate molasses
    - "Garnish: 1 mint leaf"
    steps:
    - In the bottom of a shaker, muddle the mint leaves in the simple syrup. 
    - Add the gin, lime juice, and pomegranate molasses and shake with ice until chilled. 
    - Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a chilled cocktail glass. 
    - Garnish with the mint leaf.

      The Port of Call may be the best-selling holiday cocktail of all time at Clover Club. Created by head bartender Tom Macy, this drink not only tastes like fall, but also gives you something to do with all your leftover cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Tanqueray gin
    - 1 ounce Sandeman ruby port
    - ¾ ounce lemon juice
    - ½ ounce cinnamon syrup
    - 1 teaspoon cranberry preserves (or cranberry sauce)
    - Crushed ice
    - "Garnish: mint sprig and 1 raspberry"
    steps:
    - Shake the gin, port, lemon juice, cinnamon syrup, and cranberry preserves with ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a rocks glass filled with crushed ice and garnish with the mint sprig and raspberry.

      Thanksgiving is about the main meal, sure. But it's also about all the hours of work leading up to it. At my house, the first cocktail is mixed long before the turkey emerges from the oven. Around noon, I'll set out a cheese plate to hold everyone over until dinner; this cocktail with a slice of funky cheese is one of my favorite pairings of the holiday season.
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Old Overholt rye whiskey
    - ¾ ounce lemon juice
    - ¼ ounce orange juice
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - ½ ounce medium-bodied red wine
    steps:
    - Shake the rye, lemon juice, orange juice, and simple syrup with ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a coupe and top with the wine.
    - The red wine should be added delicately to ensure that it floats above the whiskey sour underneath. 
    - The tannins in the wine dry out the cocktail with each sip, making for a beautifully layered drink. 
    - Measure the wine in your jigger and slowly pour it onto the back of a bar spoon positioned over the surface of the drink to apply it to the top of the cocktail.

      For years, the leftover cranberry sauce in our refrigerator would long outlast the leftover mashed potatoes or turkey. Finally I realized that cranberry sauce makes a great cocktail ingredient; since then, it's disappeared quickly. One of my favorite ways to use it is in place of cranberry juice in a classic Cosmopolitan. The sweetness of the preserves can vary, so doctor your drink with a little simple syrup to taste.
    glassware: martini
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Absolut Citron citrus vodka
    - ¾ ounce Cointreau

    - ¼ to ½ ounce simple syrup
    - 1 heaping teaspoon cranberry sauce
    - "Garnish: Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Shake the vodka, Cointreau, lime juice, simple syrup, and cranberry sauce with ice until chilled. 
    - Double-strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a Martini glass and garnish with the orange twist.

    glassware: punch bowl
    ingredients:
    - Peel of 1 lemon
    - 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon cane syrup (I recommend Petite Canne, available for purchase online, or make by mixing equal parts cane sugar and hot water)
    - 10 ounces Bacardi 8 aged rum
    - 2½ ounces Coruba aged Jamaican rum
    - 10 ounces Pierre Ferrand Ambre VS Cognac
    - 5 ounces Licor 43
    - 10 ounces mulled cider
    - 5 ounces lemon juice
    - 5 ounces water
    - Large ice block (if serving cold)
    - "Garnish: Freshly grated nutmeg (from 4 whole nutmegs); apple wheels (from 1 apple) if serving cold or apple slices (from 1 apple) if serving warm"
    steps:
    - "TO SERVE COLD: Place the lemon peel and cane syrup in a pitcher and gently muddle. Let sit for 30 minutes. Add the rums, Cognac, Licor 43, mulled cider, lemon juice, and water and stir to combine. Refrigerate for one hour before serving. Strain into a punch bowl over the large ice block and garnish the punch bowl with the nutmeg and apple wheels."
    - "TO SERVE WARM: Place the lemon peel and cane syrup in a stockpot and gently muddle. Let sit for 30 minutes. Add the rums, Cognac, Licor 43, mulled cider, lemon juice, and water and heat on the stove over medium heat until hot but not boiling, about 10 minutes. (Do not let it boil.) To make one serving, ladle a few ounces of the punch into a warm mug and garnish with nutmeg and an apple slice."

  #Fireside Drinks
  - name: Hot Toddy
    notes: |+2
      The hot toddy is really more of a rubric than a strict recipe. At its most basic, it's a mixture of liquor, hot water, and sugar. While whiskey is traditional, Cognac and rum make equally delicious cocktails; swap in hot tea for water and experiment with different sweeteners.
    glassware: mug
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces whiskey
    - 1 teaspoon demerara syrup
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    - 3 ounces boiling water
    - "Ganish: long lemon peel and 4 cloves"
    steps:
    - Fill your mug or snifter with some hot water to warm it. To make a long lemon peel, cut the skin in a circular fashion with a peeler, rotating the lemon to get a long enough peel. 
    - Pierce the peel with 4 cloves and set aside. 
    - Empty the water from your mug. 
    - Add the whiskey, demerara syrup, bitters, and boiling water. 
    - Garnish with the clove-studded lemon peel.

  #Repeal Day
  - name: Scofflaw

      “Scofflaw” was a name given to people who frequented speakeasies and disagreed with the National Prohibition Act. The cocktail followed shortly after the term was coined, in 1924. This drink is a regular on our Repeal Day menu for obvious reasons.

  - name: Clover Club
    notes: |+2
      My second bar is named for both a cocktail and a place. The cocktail, listed here, is a gin drink for people who hate gin, at turns fruity and dry. In my version, dry vermouth adds a necessary layer of flavor that keeps the raspberry syrup in check. But before the drink, Clover Club was the name of a gentlemen's club based out of the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. Founded in 1882, it ran through the 1920s and its membership was made up of the intellectual elite of the time, including many respected journalists and writers. It was the tradition that invited guests—generally celebrities and politicians—would give an address to the club, and each was subjected to the sharp-witted comments of the audience when he finished. These roasts were well documented and word of them spread far and wide. I find it humorous that the original Clover Club was a real boys' club, and that my Clover Club is run by three women. I like to think we are snarky and bawdy enough to have held our own with those boys.
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Plymouth gin
    - ½ ounce Dolin dry vermouth
    - ½ ounce lemon juice
    - ½ ounce raspberry syrup (alternatively, muddle 5 raspberries in ½ ounce simple syrup)
    - ½ ounce egg white (about half the white of 1 egg)
    - "Garnish: 2 raspberries"
    steps:
    - In a shaker, combine the gin, vermouth, lemon juice, raspberry syrup, and egg white. 
    - Shake without ice for 20 seconds to emulsify the egg white, then add ice and shake until chilled. 
    - Strain into a coupe glass, spear the berries on a pick, and lay it across the rim of the glass to garnish.

    - 14 ounces demerara syrup
    - Large ice block
    - "Garnish: Lemon wheels (from 1 or 2 lemons) and 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg"
    steps:
    - In a large nonreactive container with a lid, combine the lemon peels and the sugar and muddle until the sugar looks slightly moistened. 
    - Cover and let the mixture sit for at least an hour, or overnight. 
    - Add the Cognac, rum, tea, lemon juice, and demerara syrup. Stir, then strain into a punch bowl.

Instead they create lovely balance and depth in the glass.

      The winter of 2013 was an exceptionally cold one, so I created this flip, which has heavy cream and a whole egg, to fight the blustery temperature. It went over so well that I served it to my family on Christmas Day.
    glassware: wine glass
    ingredients:
    - 3 (or 18) ounces Lustau East India Solera sherry
    - 1 (or 6) ounce Ron Zacapa Centenario 23 Años rum

    - ½ (or 3) ounce simple syrup (or cinnamon syrup)
    - 1 (or 5) small egg
    - "Garnish: Freshly grated nutmeg"
    steps:
    - Combine the sherry, rum, cream, syrup, and egg in a shaker and shake without ice to emulsify the egg. You will want to shake for a good 30 to 45 seconds. Add ice to the shaker and shake again, until chilled. Strain into a wineglass over fresh ice and garnish with nutmeg.
    - "To make 6 drinks: Combine the sherry, rum, cream, syrup, and eggs in a blender and blend on high speed to incorporate. Store in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve. To serve, pour 5 to 6 ounces into a wineglass filled with ice and garnish with nutmeg."

      I'm not sure how port became synonymous with the holidays, but without fail I receive a bottle of the stuff as a gift at some point during the month of December. Not that I'm complaining; there are some great ports out there. This is one of the ways I put these gifts to good use.
    glassware: punch bowl
    ingredients:
    - Peels of 2 lemons
    - ½ cup superfine sugar
    - 4 ounces lemon juice
    - 16 ounces bourbon, Cognac, or applejack
    - 8 ounces ruby port (I recommend Sandeman)
    - 2 cups water
    - Large ice block
    - "Garnish: 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg"
    steps:
    - In a large nonreactive container with a lid, muddle the lemon peels and the sugar together until the sugar looks slightly moistened. Cover and let the mixture sit for at least 1 hour, or overnight.
    - Muddle the peels again and add the lemon juice, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Add the spirit, port, and water and stir again. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
    - Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a punch bowl, discarding the lemon peels. Add the ice block to the punch bowl (or add large ice cubes to individual cups) and sprinkle nutmeg over the top. To serve, ladle into small cups.

  - name: Port Wine Cobbler
    author: Julie Reiner
    notes: |+2
      The cobbler was born in the mid-1800s, with the advent of suddenly available ice. It was also among the first cocktails to be sipped through a straw. Loosely defined as a wine-based spirit, sugar, fruit, and crushed ice, the earliest cobblers were most frequently made with sherry. This version, made with ruby port, has appeared on the menus at both Flatiron Lounge and Clover Club. Like the mint julep, it is served on crushed ice, but it is much lower in alcohol, making it an easygoing afternoon cocktail.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 1 lemon wedge (⅛ of a lemon)
    - 1 orange wedge (⅛ of an orange)
    - 3 cubes (1-inch) pineapple
    - ¾ ounce orange curaçao (I recommend Pierre Ferrand Dry)
    - 2½ ounces ruby port (I recommend Sandeman)
    - ½ ounce Cognac (I recommend Louis Royer Force 53 VSOP)
    - Crushed ice
    - "Garnish: Orange half wheel, mint leaf, pineapple slice, and lemon wheel"
    steps:
    - In the bottom of a shaker, muddle the lemon, orange, and pineapple with the orange curaçao. 
    - Add the port and Cognac and shake with ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a Collins glass filled with crushed ice and insert the garnish ingredients into the ice at the top of the glass.

    notes: |+2
      Who says that Pimm's is a summer liqueur? Add Champagne, and it becomes a party drink for all seasons, as this punch proves. Pimm's was created in the 1840s by an English oyster bar owner, and it became one of the most popular beverages in England. The exact recipe is a secret, but we do know that it is a gin-based liqueur flavored with spices and fruit. It is generally consumed in the Pimm's Cup with ginger ale and a fancy fruit garnish. This festive punch takes it one step farther, letting it macerate with fruit and then adding Champagne rather than soda. Serves 10 to 15.
    glassware: punch bowl
    ingredients:
    - Peels of 2 lemons, plus 2 lemons sliced into wheels
    - ¼ cup granulated sugar
    - 1½ cups thinly sliced cucumber wheels
    - ½ grapefruit, sliced into wheels
    - 1 orange, sliced into wheels
    - 16 ounces Pimm's No. 1
    - 4 ounces orange juice
    - 2 ounces lemon juice
    - 1 (750-ml) bottle Champagne
    - Large ice block
    - "Garnish: 6 strawberries, hulled and sliced"
    steps:
    - Place the peels in a glass pitcher or bowl with the sugar (save the lemons for juicing). Muddle the peels until the sugar looks slightly moistened, then cover and let sit for at least 1 hour, or overnight.
    - Add the lemon wheels, cucumber wheels, grapefruit wheels, orange wheels, Pimm's, orange juice, and lemon juice. Stir until the sugar has completely dissolved and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. You can make this the night before to cut your workload down on New Year's Eve.
    - When you are ready to serve, transfer the mixture (including the fruit) to a punch bowl and slowly add the Champagne and the ice. Garnish the bowl with the strawberry slices. To serve, ladle into punch glasses.
    - This punch can also be served Sangria-style in a pitcher and poured over ice.

  - name: The Old Cuban
    author: Audrey Saunders
    notes: |+2
      This is by far the most popular New Year's cocktail I have served in my bars. It was created by Audrey Saunders of Pegu Club back in 2000, and was conceived as a Champagne Mojito. The addition of aged rum and Angostura bitters gives it those holiday spice notes we expect from our winter cocktails, while the Champagne keeps it festive. The Old Cuban is elegant and sophisticated, perfect for any special occasion.
    year: 2000
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 6 mint leaves
    - ¾ ounce lime juice
    - 1 ounce simple syrup

    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 2 ounces Champagne
    - "Garnish: 1 mint leaf"
    steps:
    - In the bottom of a shaker, gently muddle the 6 mint leaves with the lime juice and the simple syrup. 
    - Add the rum and bitters and fill the glass with ice. 
    - Shake well until chilled and double-strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large coupe or a Martini glass. 
    - Top with the Champagne, and lay the remaining mint leaf on the surface of the drink.

  #Mardi Gras
  - name: Vieux Carré
    notes: |+2
      This 1930s New Orleans cocktail is named after the city's French quarter. The drink was created by Walter Bergeron at the Hotel Monteleone, which is still standing and now serves as the headquarters for Tales of the Cocktail, the largest bartending industry event in the country.
    glassware: double rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Cognac (I recommend Pierre Ferrand 1840)
    - 1 ounce rye whiskey (I recommend Wild Turkey)
    - 1 ounce sweet vermouth (I recommend Carpano Antica Formula)
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters
    - 1 teaspoon Bénédictine
    - "Garnish: Lemon twist"
    steps:
    - In a mixing glass, combine the Cognac, rye, vermouth, both bitters, and Bénédictine. 
    - Fill the glass with ice and stir until chilled. 
    - Strain into a double rocks glass over fresh ice and garnish with the lemon twist.

      "The Sazerac has a hugely important place in the history of New Orleans and the history of American cocktails at large. It was allegedly the first cocktail to be created and recorded that varied from the original idea of a “cocktail”—what we now know as an Old Fashioned—with the addition of absinthe and Peychaud's bitters. Though the drink was originally made with Cognac, rye whiskey eventually became the standard spirit. Prepare yourself: This drink is serious!"
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - ¼ ounce Herbsaint or absinthe
    - 2 ounces rye whiskey (I recommend Rittenhouse)
    - 1 teaspoon simple syrup
    - 6 dashes Peychaud's bitters
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - "Garnish: Lemon twist"
    steps:
    - Rinse a rocks glass with Herbsaint or absinthe by rolling the liquid around the interior of the glass so that it coats the glass's surface. Discard any excess. 
    - In a mixing glass, combine the rye, simple syrup, and both bitters. 
    - Add ice and stir until chilled. 
    - Strain the rye mixture into the coated glass without ice. 
    - Squeeze the lemon twist over the cocktail to express its oils. 
    - Purists discard the twist, but some people prefer to drop it in the glass as a garnish.

      The Brandy Crusta, which was created in 1852 in New Orleans, was meant to be an improvement on the Old Fashioned. The name refers to the sugar crusted around the rim of the glass. The drink is the precursor to the Sidecar, one of the most popular Cognac cocktails ever created.

    - ½ ounce Cointreau
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    steps:
    - "Prepare the glass and garnish: With a citrus peeler in one hand and the lemon in the other, start at the top of the lemon and peel on a slight diagonal, turning the lemon, until you get to the bottom. You should have one long peel when you are finished."
    - "Cut the lemon in half, and rub the inside of one half on the rim of a wineglass or coupe to moisten it. Put a few tablespoons of the sugar in a small bowl. Roll the rim of the glass in the sugar. (See here for technique.)"
    - Coil the peel inside the glass so that it lines the interior wall, adding ice to keep it in place.
    - "Prepare the cocktail: With a hand juicer, juice the lemon and strain out the pulp. Add ½ ounce of the juice to a shaker, along with the Cognac, maraschino liqueur, Cointreau, and bitters. Shake with ice until chilled. Strain into the prepared glass."

  #Brunch
  - name: Aperol Spritz

      Aperol, an Italian aperitif similar to Campari, is the ultimate brunch spirit. Bright in flavor and in color, it is the ideal balance of sweet and bitter. The classic way to enjoy this beguiling liquor is in a spritz, a cocktail you'll see on every cobblestoned street in Italy. The mixture of Aperol, prosecco, and club soda, garnished with an orange wedge, is dead simple and undeniably delicious.
    glassware: wine glass
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Aperol
    - 3 ounces prosecco
    - 1 ounce club soda
    - "Garnish: Orange slice"
    steps:

      This Italian highball is a classic that gets its edge from the bitterness of Campari. I love it as a brunch drink because it soothes a hangover whie cutting through the richness of my favorite brunch dishes, such as Clover Club's pork and grits.
    glassware: highball
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces sweet vermouth (I recommend Carpano Antica Formula)
    - 1½ ounces Campari
    - Club soda
    - "Garnish: Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Fill a highball glass with ice and add the sweet vermouth and Campari. 
    - Top with the club soda and gently stir with a bar spoon. 
    - Garnish with the orange twist.

      "Drinks have a tendency to look different in the sunshine, so if I know that I'm creating a cocktail for a brunch event, I take extra care to make sure it is beautiful. This is one such drink: It's a showstopper and will look gorgeous on your table. Serves 10."
    glassware: flute
    ingredients:
    - 10  strawberries, hulled
    - 5 ounces simple syrup
    - 10 ounces gin (I recommend Fords or Beefeater 24)
    - 5 ounces chilled lemon juice
    - 1 (750-ml)  bottle Champagne or sparkling wine (for a splurge, I recommend Moët & Chandon)
    - "Garnish: Strawberry slices (from 4 hulled strawberries) or spiral lemon twists (from 3 lemons)"
    steps:
    - Place the strawberries and simple syrup in a blender and blend thoroughly. 
    - Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher, discarding the solids. 
    - Add the gin and lemon juice to the pitcher, then slowly pour in the Champagne and stir to incorporate. 
    - To serve, pour 5 ounces of the mixture into a chilled flute and garnish with a strawberry slice or lemon twist.

      There isn't much to this sparkling drink, but you'd be amazed at the difference between the Champagne Cobbler and a flute of unadulterated bubbly. The oils and simple syrup stretch out the wine's dry notes, while the crushed ice dilutes it into a daytime affair. It's also a visual stunner; if I make one, everyone will immediately request one of their own.

    steps:

    - Add the syrup and the lemon and orange twists, and stir with a bar spoon. 
    - Fill the rest of the glass with more crushed ice. 
    - Loosely place the raspberries and blackberry on the surface of the drink to garnish.

      Judging cocktail competitions has become a part of my routine these days, so you can imagine how many cocktails I taste on a monthly basis. But when I first tried this savory gin drink, now featured on Clover Club's brunch menu, it was unlike any cocktail I had ever experienced. Its creator, Tom Macy, essentially put spring in a glass! The combination of gin, sugar snap peas, and tarragon is magical and impressively savory.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 4 sugar snap peas, trimmed and snapped in half
    - 8 to 10  fresh tarragon leaves
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup
    - 2 ounces Hayman's Old Tom gin
    - ½ ounce dry vermouth
    - ¾ ounce lemon juice
    - Crushed ice
    - "Garnish: 1 sugar snap pea"
    steps:
    - In the bottom of a shaker, muddle the 4 sugar snap peas and the tarragon leaves in the simple syrup. 
    - Add the gin, vermouth, and lemon juice and shake with cubed ice. 
    - Double-strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a rocks glass filled with crushed ice. 
    - To garnish, insert the sugar snap pea, with top pod removed, into the crushed ice.

      "Before there were a million specialty liqueurs, I would do what I called “shopping the shelves” for inspiration: I'd go to a handful of gourmet stores to see what kinds of ingredients they had that I'd never tried, and then I'd buy some and experiment with them behind the bar. That's how I came across Belvoir elderflower cordial, essentially an alcohol-free St. Germain. The floral flavor echoes the botanicals frequently found in gins and vermouths. This recipe is the mocktail version of the Juniper Breeze."
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 2½ ounces grapefruit juice
    - 1 ounce cranberry juice
    - ½ ounce Belvoir elderflower cordial
    - 1 teaspoon lime juice
    - "Garnish: Grapefruit slice"
    steps:
    - In a rocks glass filled with ice, combine the grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, elderflower cordial, and lime juice. 
    - Roll to mix and garnish with the grapefruit slice.

      This drink is the nonalcoholic cousin of a cocktail that appeared on the menu at Flatiron Lounge. Normally I keep my distance from dairy in cocktails, but this drink was too delicious to avoid on principle. It makes an incredibly indulgent morning beverage. If you are very strictly avoiding alcohol, make this drink without the bitters, which have an alcoholic base. If, on the other hand, you're looking to up the alcohol quotient, adding 1½ ounces of chai-infused rum will turn this beverage into an incredible cocktail.
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces brewed chai tea, sweetened and chilled
    - 1½ ounces whole milk
    - 1 teaspoon grade B maple syrup
    - ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - White of 1 small egg
    - "Garnish: Freshly grated nutmeg"
    steps:
    - In a shaker, combine the tea, milk, maple syrup, vanilla extract, bitters, and egg white. 
    - Shake without ice for 30 seconds to emulsify the egg white. 
    - Add ice and shake well to chill, then strain into a chilled coupe and garnish with nutmeg.

      My childhood home in Hawaii had a mango tree in the backyard, and we were always scrambling to come up with new ways to use the fruit. Inevitably it would end up in the blender, as Margaritas for my parents and smoothies for me. One of my chores was to rake up the leaves from under the tree, and on the day of my junior prom, some of the sap from the tree fell on my shoulder as I was raking. I must have had an allergic reaction, because in all the pictures of me in my prom dress, my shoulder is red and splotchy. But even that embarrassment couldn't quell my love of mangoes; this drink is an ode to the mango smoothies of my youth.
    glassware: hurricane
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces mango and passion fruit puree
    - 1 ounce passion fruit juice
    - ½ ounce lime juice
    - ½ ounce lemon juice

    - "Garnish: Orchid"
    steps:
    - Shake the puree, juices, and simple syrup with ice until chilled. 
    - Strain into a hurricane glass. Garnish with an orchid.

Some people like to sip the tequila separately from the cocktail, but I like to pour my shot right into the glass and enjoy it like a Bloody Mary. I promise that your guests will flock to try out this interactive combo. Serves 5."
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 1 jalapeño, sliced in half and seeded (leave the seeds in for a spicier Sangrita)

    - 6 ounces orange juice
    - 2 ounces grapefruit juice

    - Pinch smoked paprika
    - Pinch white pepper
    - 10 ounces blanco tequila (I recommend Partida Blanco)

    - Stir, cover, and let the mixture sit in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove the jalapeño.

  #Derby Day
  - name: Classic Mint Julep
    notes: |+2
      This classic beverage is a mini-evolution in a glass. The drink is at its strongest in the beginning, before the ice has had a chance to melt. There is a sweet spot about ten minutes after the drink is made where the dilution is perfect. And by the time you reach the end, the bourbon has been watered down to a deliciously refreshing slushy. Aromatics are essential to the julep-drinking experience. I garnish each julep with a few huge mint sprigs placed right next to the straw so that my guests get a burst of that delicious smell with every sip.
    glassware: julep tin
    ingredients:
    - 8 to 10 mint leaves
    - ½ ounce demerara syrup
    - 2 ounces bourbon
    - Crushed ice
    - "Garnish: 3 mint sprigs"
    steps:
    - In a chilled julep cup or rocks glass, muddle the mint with the demerara syrup. 
    - Add the bourbon and fill the glass halfway with crushed ice. Swizzle with a bar spoon. 
    - Top with more ice and swizzle until there is a frost on the outside of the cup. 
    - Garnish with the mint sprigs.

      This cocktail, popularized by Dale DeGroff, is the godfather of muddled drinks and a natural forebear of creations like the Caipirinha and the Mojito. By muddling pieces of lemon, you get the flavor of both the juice and the essential oils in the peels, which add an impressive layer of complexity.
    glassware: rocks

    - 3 lemon wedges
    - 5 mint leaves
    - ¾ ounce simple syrup

    steps:
    - In the bottom of a shaker, muddle the lemon wedges and mint with the simple syrup. 
    - Add the bourbon and shake with ice until chilled.

      This version of the julep uses mint tea syrup instead of fresh mint. It's a great option if you're hosting a large crowd, since there's no muddling involved and you can make the syrup ahead of time.

      I've learned to rely on jams and preserves when I don't have more fresh ingredients (such as stone fruit) on hand. And since the South is all about pickling and preserving, relying on these put-ups seems an appropriate homage to the home of the Derby. You can absolutely swap out the apricot jam for another type; orange marmalade, berry jam, or plum preserves would all make delicious variations.

      It's a general rule that you mix lemon juice with brown spirits and lime juice with clear spirits. But rules are meant to be broken, and I've done so here with delicious results.

      If you're in need of an alternative to mint, this drink is a great way to go. Peaches can be overwhelmingly sweet, so it takes a strong, boozy spirit like bourbon to keep them in check. The sparkling wine lightens it up enough to warrant afternoon drinking. If you choose to muddle fresh peach, you may need to increase the volume of simple syrup, since the sweetness of peaches varies.
