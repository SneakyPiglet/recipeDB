#Highballs
  - name: Toki Highball
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: 
    ingredients:
    - Suntory Toki Whisky
    - Chilled soda water
    - Citrus twist (optional)
    steps:
    - Take the highball glass and fill it with ice. If the glass has been stored in the freezer, you are all set. If not, simply stir the ice around to sufficiently chill the glass, then strain out any water.
    - Gently pour a jigger’s worth of Suntory Toki Whisky into the glass and stir lightly, adding more ice, if necessary.
    - Slowly and deliberately pour chilled soda water into the glass, aiming for the glass’s side wall, not the ice itself, since the shock of the impact with the ice will dissipate the soda water’s carbonation.
    - Using a stirrer, gently lift the ice up and down a couple of times to mix the whisky and soda water, and give it a slow, gentle stir.
    - A citrus twist garnish is optional, with lemons, limes, yuzu, or other citrus fruits all popular.

    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: With aki meaning “autumn,” this highball is a celebration of all things fall, and a popular seasonal serve at Katana Kitten. In Japan, during the cooler months, hojicha, or roasted green tea, is very popular. It is produced by toasting dried green tea leaves in porcelain pans over charcoal fires. This imparts a faintly warm, toasty flavor. The aroma, for me, conjures up the same feeling people get when they smell a pile of raked leaves burning on a fall afternoon. It is the essence of the season. In this cocktail, I use toasted jasmine tea to evoke the same sense memory. To provide a citrus kick, I use pomelo, which is an enormous grapefruit-like fruit. Its zest is very aromatic, so we incorporate it in a syrup. The flesh is rather dry and doesn’t produce a lot of juice when squeezed, so we dehydrate it and blend it with salt to use as a tasty garnish.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Olmeca Altos Plata tequila
    - ¾ ounce ruby grapefruit juice
    - ¼ ounce yuzu juice
    - ¾ ounce Toasted Jasmine-Pomelo Syrup
    - Soda water, chilled
    - "Garnish: Smoked Pomelo Salt"
    steps:
    - Combine the tequila, grapefruit juice, yuzu juice, and syrup in a highball glass with an ice spear or a stack of ice cubes. Stir gently and top with chilled soda water. Garnish with smoked pomelo salt.

    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: My take on the classic Dark ’n’ Stormy gets a colorful twist courtesy of a splash of rum infused with butterfly pea flower, a Southeast Asian plant commonly used for beverages and desserts, and the source of the drink’s distinctive blue hue. Beyond rum, the cocktail incorporates tepache, a fermented beverage popular in Mexico, typically made with pineapple skins, cinnamon, and piloncillo, an unrefined natural cane sugar popular throughout Latin America. The first time I saw a jar of tepache was when one of our barbacks left a batch of it in the walk-in cooler at Saxon + Parole. Due to its funky and suspicious look, I almost tossed it. But thankfully, I came around to appreciating it. Our house version uses the traditional pineapple skins and gives it an Asian twist with lemongrass and ginger, which salutes the Dark ’n’ Stormy’s ginger beer.
    ingredients:
    - 5 ounces Ginger-Lemongrass Tepache 
    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
    - 1¾ ounces Butterfly Pea Flower Tea-Infused Banks 5 Island Rum
    - "Garnish: dehydrated pineapple wheel"
    steps:
    - Place an ice spear or a stack of ice cubes in a frozen highball stein, then add the tepache and lime juice. Using the back of a barspoon, float the rum on top to create a vibrant purple layer as the top third of the drink. Garnish with a dehydrated pineapple wheel.

  - name: Melon-Lime Soda
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: I have lived in New York City for more than a decade, and during this time I have made countless vodka-sodas with lime for guests. The Melon-Lime Soda is my Japanese-accented salute to this simple yet extremely ubiquitous drink. This drink is super-refreshing and a carefully balanced layering of all things green. Its vibrant green hue comes from Midori reinforced by matcha. Midori, popular here during the Days of Disco, is an emerald-colored, muskmelon flavored liqueur. Absolut Lime vodka, a housemade matcha-lime cordial, and a blend of the juice of limes and sudachi, a Japanese citrus fruit with a zesty, sour tang, make for a uniquely tart sipping experience. Interestingly, Midori has an intimate connection to Saturday Night Fever, the film that helped usher in the aforementioned glittery era and catapulted John Travolta to movie stardom. The movie premiered in Manhattan, and the afterparty was held at Ian Schrager’s legendary Studio 54, where, earlier that evening, Midori was introduced to the US for the very first time. Come to think of it, maybe I should have called the drink “Stayin’ Alive”!
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Absolut Lime vodka
    - 1 ounce Midori
    - ½ ounce Matcha-Lime Cordial
    - ¼ ounce sudachi juice
    - ¼ ounce fresh lime juice
    - Soda water, chilled
    - "Garnish: fresh lime leaf"
    steps:
    - Place an ice spear or a stack of ice cubes in a frozen highball stein. Add the vodka, Midori, matcha-lime cordial, sudachi juice, and lime juice. Top off with chilled soda water and gently stir. Garnish with a lime leaf.

  - name: Ringo Collins
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: While I love the Beatles, the word ringo here refers to the Japanese word for “apple.” Apples grow throughout much of Japan, including in my home prefecture, Nagano, where Fuji apples are particularly prized. So, for this Collins variation at Katana Kitten, I wanted to harness the fruit’s incredible aromatic properties. I chose a base of California brandy infused with Earl Grey tea. The tea’s bergamot citrus notes really bring out the sweet aromatics of the apple. A bit of sherry and umeshu, Japan’s iconic plum liqueur, lengthen and lighten the drink. Since we juice our own apples to make our Fuji Apple–Maple Sherbet, we take the leftover pulp and turn it into fruit leather that we then cut into a maple leaf shape for the drink’s garnish.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Earl Grey Tea-Infused Brandy
    - ¾ ounce dry umeshu
    - ¾ ounce Manzanilla sherry
    - ¾ ounce Fuji Apple-Maple Sherbet
    - Soda water, chilled
    - "Garnish: maple leaf-shaped piece of Fruit Leather and grated nutmeg"
    steps:
    - Place an ice spear or a stack of ice cubes in a frozen highball stein. Add the brandy, umeshu, sherry, and sherbet. Stir gently and top with chilled soda water. Garnish with a maple leaf–shaped piece of fruit leather and grated nutmeg.

  - name: Shiso Gin & Tonic
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This highball is one of our top sellers, and we use it to highlight the flavor of shiso, a fragrant Japanese leaf that I grow in a community garden in Brooklyn. The gin I use here is Fords gin, created by eighth-generation distiller Charles Maxwell of Thames Distillery, together with Simon Ford, a beloved figure in the bar world. Its juniper-forward profile and citrusy and floral notes make a great base for my take on a classic gin and tonic. It’s spiked with an aromatic cordial with a bitter backbone that’s invigorated by shiso, an herb that marries the fragrant qualities of mint and basil. Unlike most cordials or syrups that are heated and essentially “cook” their flavoring ingredients, this one is prepared at room temperature to ensure that the pure, vibrant flavor of fresh shiso comes shining through.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Fords gin (or your favorite London dry-style gin)
    - ¾ ounce Shiso-Quinine Cordial
    - ⅓ ounce fresh lime juice
    - Soda water, chilled
    - "Garnish: shiso leaf"
    steps:
    - Place an ice spear or a stack of ice cubes in a frozen highball stein. Add the gin, cordial, and lime juice to the glass, top with chilled soda water, and gently stir. Garnish with a shiso leaf.

  - name: Yuzu Spritz
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: The Yuzu Spritz is one of the most quaffable highballs at Katana Kitten. It is both easy to drink and delightfully refreshing. Umeshu is a fruity, sweet, and fragrant Japanese liqueur made from unripe green ume (plums) and a white spirit or shochu. It’s often made at home, with families passing down their own recipes from generation to generation. In this cocktail, it’s a great companion to the delicate Manzanilla sherry and the gentian-based French liqueur Salers. An added dash of salinity comes with asazuke (quick-pickled) cucumbers.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Choya umeshu 
    - 1 ounce Manzanilla sherry
    - ½ ounce Salers Apéritif
    - ¾ ounce Yuzu-Lemon Sherbet Syrup
    - Soda water, chilled
    - "Garnish: 3 slices of Cucumber Asazuke on a skewer"
    steps:
    - Place an ice spear or a stack of ice cubes in a frozen highball stein. Add the umeshu, sherry, Salers, and sherbet syrup. Top off with chilled soda water and stir gently. Garnish with 3 slices of cucumber asazuke on a skewer.

#Cocktails
  - name: Hinoki Martini
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This cocktail is my take on a well-made saketini, and it is very special to me. Over the years, I have been asked numerous times to make this drink, which is basically a vodka martini with sake substituted for the dry vermouth. The sake typically makes the drink a bit sweeter and rounder. For our rendition, I wanted to create a cocktail that honored the Japanese traditional sake serve and the classic dry martini. Hinoki is the Japanese cypress that is used to make the masu, the wooden cup used to serve sake. When sake is poured into a masu, the scent of cypress becomes part of the experience. To re-create this sensation, I had to source the essence of hinoki, which did not exist. We solved this by creating our own. Unfortunately, you can’t exactly re-create this cocktail as I make it at Katana Kitten without a few drops of a key ingredient, a cypress tree distillate, but I’ve provided a handy workaround to create an approximation. The presentation of the drink is inspired by the traditional sake serve, where a glass is placed in a masu and filled until it overflows into the masu, a sign of expansive generosity. We serve the drink in a custom wooden masu created for us by Cocktail Kingdom. The masu is filled with crushed ice, so the entire surface of the stemless cocktail glass containing the drink has contact with the ice to keep it absolutely cold to the very last sip. To obtain the cypress aroma, I collaborated with Jeff Lindauer, a good friend of mine from Spring44 Distilling in Colorado. We went up into the Rocky Mountains where cypress trees grow in abundance. We identified a varietal that is closest to Japanese cypress, chopped it down, and extracted cypress oil. We first tried a maceration, but it didn’t quite capture the flavor, so we fired up the still and created a 140-proof distillate. The unique and irreplaceable flavor of the tree is captured in the bottle. In this recipe, I provide the closest approximation, which is a homemade hinoki tincture. If you can’t source hinoki wood chips, experiment with other types of wood or omit the tincture completely. You will still have a delightfully dry martini to enjoy.
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ ounces Grey Goose vodka
    - 1¼ ounces Spring44 Mountain Gin
    - ½ ounce Lustau “Solera Reserva” fino jarana sherry
    - ¼ ounce Dassai 50 junmai daiginjo sake
    - 5 dashes Hinoki Tincture
    - "Garnish: lemon twist, kombu-brined olive, rakkyo (pickled Japanese scallion bulb), and cypress leaf"
    steps:
    - Fill a square wooden masu cup with pebble ice and place a chilled stemless martini glass in the ice. Combine the vodka, gin, sherry, sake, and hinoki tincture in a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir until chilled and strain into the glass. Express a lemon twist over the surface of the drink and discard, then spray four bursts of hinoki tincture over the drink. Delicately adorn the pebble ice around the glass with a kombu-brined olive, rakkyo, and a cypress leaf.

  - name: Amaretto Sour
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This is my homage to Portland, Oregon, bartender and author Jeffrey Morgenthaler, who created an improved version of the 1970s-era amaretto sour by cutting its treacly namesake liqueur with a high-proof American whiskey to dry it out. Our riff gets an added kick from a high-proof rye, but our special Katana Kitten touch is the addition of a Salted Plum Shrub, which provides a lingering umami taste and a unique salinity. Despite its subtle flavor, this drink hits all the senses, and that’s why people order it again and again. The final touch is yukari, a Japanese seasoning made from salted and dried red shiso leaves.
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ ounce Wild Turkey 101 rye
    - ¾ ounce Lazzaroni amaretto
    - ¾ ounce Salted Plum Shrub
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce egg white
    - "Garnish: lemon twist and a sprinkle of yukari (salted and dried red shiso)"
    steps:
    - Combine the rye, amaretto, shrub, lemon juice, and egg white in a cocktail shaker and dry shake without ice to emulsify the egg white. Add ice and shake until chilled. Strain into a double old-fashioned glass over a 2-inch ice cube. Express a lemon twist over the drink and discard, then garnish with a sprinkle of yukari.

  - name: Meguroni
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: The classic Negroni has inspired countless variations, and Katana Kitten’s is named after Meguro, the Tokyo neighborhood nearby where I used to live. The banks of the Meguro River are lined with thousands of sakura (cherry blossom) trees, and when the blossoms are in season, locals head over to take in the gorgeous views. In this drink, I swap out the traditional gin for genever, since its round and malty flavors work best with the drink’s other ingredients. Instead of vermouth, we use a full-bodied umeshu (plum liqueur) that has a color akin to sweet vermouth and a similar sweetness level, yet tastes completely different and totally transforms the drink. The umeshu’s base is actually Japanese blackstrap rum. Lastly, instead of the traditional Campari, we opt for an aperitivo liqueur made with bitter Calabrian oranges. The final touch is a garnish of fresh kinome leaves.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Old Duff Dutch genever
    - ¾ ounce Choya Kokuto umeshu
    - ¾ ounce Caffo Red Bitter
    - "Garnish: lemon twist and fresh kinome leaves"
    steps:
    - Combine the genever, umeshu, and Caffo Red Bitter in a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir until chilled and strain into a double old-fashioned glass or teacup over ice. Express a lemon twist over the drink and discard, and garnish with fresh kinome leaves.

  - name: Yuzu-Shio Daiquiri
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: The base of this Katana Kitten take on a daiquiri highlights a Japanese rum, Cor Cor. The rum is produced on the small, remote island of Minamidaito in Okinawa Prefecture. Cor Cor cultivates their own sugarcane on their estate and produces two expressions, one from sugarcane juice in the style of a rhum agricole and one from molasses, which we use in this cocktail. It is a very unique and pungent rum that has a lot of earthy notes you would expect from a Jamaican rum or a Haitian clairin, which we balance with a dry Barbados rum. To complement the lime and yuzu juices, we make a syrup that combines shio koji, a Japanese condiment made of salt, water and rice koji, and pandan leaves.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Mount Gay silver rum
    - ½ ounce Cor Cor Red Okinawan rum
    - ¾ ounce Shio Koji Pandan Syrup
    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ¼ ounce yuzu juice
    - "Garnish: dehydrated lime wheel"
    steps:
    - Combine the rums, pandan syrup, lime juice, and yuzu juice in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake and strain into a coupe. Garnish with a dehydrated lime wheel.

  - name: Calpico Swizzle
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This exuberant swizzle gets its name from Calpico, a Japanese soft drink I loved during my childhood, which has a milky, yogurt-like flavor. It gets a decidedly more adult kick with the addition of fragrant gin and nigori sake, which is unfiltered and has a cloudy or milky appearance and a silky mouthfeel on the palate. A bit of blue curaçao keeps things vibrant, along with some bubbles from a dry sparkling wine, and this colorful drink is garnished with a bright red cocktail cherry. At Katana Kitten, we prefer the cherries from the brand Filthy Food, since their vibrant color is natural. A sprinkling of freshly ground sansho peppercorns imparts a unique aroma.
    ingredients:
    - ¾ ounce Bombay Sapphire East gin
    - ¾ ounce nigori sake
    - ¾ ounce Calpico concentrate
    - ¼ ounce Giffard blue curaçao liqueur
    - ¼ ounce simple syrup
    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ¾ ounce blanc de blanc sparkling wine (a dry bubbly may be substituted)
    - "Garnish: cocktail cherry, freshly ground sansho peppercorns, fresh mint sprigs"
    steps:
    - Combine the gin, sake, Calpico, curaçao, simple syrup, lime juice, and sparkling wine in a pearl diver–style or collins glass. Fill the glass three-quarters full with pebble ice or crushed ice. Using a swizzle stick or a barspoon, stir to combine. Mound more pebble ice or crushed ice on top of the drink. Garnish with a cocktail cherry, freshly ground sansho peppercorns, and mint sprigs.

  - name: Panda Fizz
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This is by far Katana Kitten’s most copiously consumed drink. I named it after the adorable sweet bears found in Asia, and it is also a play on the word “pandan,” an aromatic leaf that is a key ingredient that brings an earthy and nutty note to the drink. But most of all, it is a celebration of Calpico, the Japanese soft drink. It is actually a perfect modifier, as it brings sweetness that is balanced by a yogurt-like tang. Calpico also works as an emulsifier, like egg whites or cream, that binds all the different flavors and ingredients together and, when topped with soda, creates a delightfully frothy head. Finally, the Calpico lends the cocktail its white appearance, which we counterbalance with black lava salt on the rim, to re-create the colors of a panda’s fur.
    ingredients:
    - Black lava salt, for rimming the glass
    - Lemon wedge, for rimming the glass
    - 1¼ ounces Suntory Haku vodka
    - ½ ounce pear eau-de-vie
    - 1 ounce Calpico concentrate
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Pandan Syrup
    - Soda water, chilled
    steps:
    - Rim a Collins glass with black lava salt. Combine the vodka, eau-de-vie, Calpico, lemon juice, and pandan syrup in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake and strain into the prepared glass over ice cubes. Top with chilled soda water and stir gently.

    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: The inspiration for this drink is the classic Mai Tai, a cocktail that conjures up beach vacations in many an imagination. I collaborated with one of our star bartenders, Laura McGinley, to give the drink a winter makeover. We named it Cool Runnings to salute the popular 1993 sports comedy of the same name about the improbable debut of the Jamaican bobsled team at the Alberta Winter Olympics. Batavia arrack provides some rummy funkiness and sweet potato shochu adds comforting notes of the baked, starchy tuber that go well with banana and chocolate. The Puffed Rice–Coconut Orgeat is the secret ingredient and adds a luxurious mouthfeel. For the garnish, we take Okinawan purple yams, slice them thinly, dehydrate the slices, then pulverize them into a powder that is replete with potato flavor and a stunning purple color.
    ingredients:
    - ¾ ounce Batavia arrack
    - ¾ ounce Asahi-Mannen sweet potato shochu
    - ¼ ounce Giffard crème de cacao
    - ¼ ounce Giffard crème de banane
    - ¾ ounce Puffed Rice–Coconut Orgeat

  - name: October Fizz
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: The origins of Oktoberfest date back to October 12, 1810, when Bavaria’s future king Ludwig married Princess Theresa and graciously invited the people of Munich to celebrate in the fields by the city gate. Over the centuries, it has evolved into a massive annual festival, where millions of liters of beer are enthusiastically imbibed over a sixteen-day period. Beer and whisky are, of course, a delicious combination, playing off their shared DNA of malted barley. This cocktail, a take on a Chicago Fizz, is my way to salute the season. It is a concoction of whisky, port, Rock & Rye, squash puree, and, of course, a bit of beer. While I created it for fall, it is easy-drinking all year long.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Mars Iwai 45 Japanese whisky
    - ¾ ounce tawny port
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Mister Katz’s Rock & Rye
    - ¼ ounce simple syrup
    - ¾ ounce egg white
    - 1 tablespoon kabocha squash or pumpkin puree
    - 3 dashes Dale DeGroff’s Pimento aromatic bitters
    - 1½ ounces Brooklyn Brewery Oktoberfest lager
    - "Garnish: grated cinnamon and roasted pumpkin seeds"
    steps:
    - Combine the whisky, port, lemon juice, Rock & Rye, simple syrup, egg white, squash puree, and bitters in a cocktail shaker and dry shake without ice. Add ice and shake until chilled, then add the beer and gently swirl the shaker to incorporate it. Strain into a fizz glass containing an ice spear or a stack of ice cubes. Garnish with grated cinnamon and roasted pumpkin seeds.

    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This cocktail is named after a popular bar that used to occupy the space that is now Katana Kitten and is our way of showing respect to those who came before us. The bar might be gone, but we do our best to honor its spirit and the people who kept it alive. The cocktail’s inspiration is the frozen margarita, but what sets it apart is our housemade Tutti-Fruity Cordial. We combine all our bar fruit and veggie odds and ends to make a fruity cordial. It is part of the ethos in Japan that maximizes every ingredient, just as my grandma would carefully wrap even the smallest end piece of a fruit or vegetable and place it respectfully in her fridge. It is very satisfying to give these precious ingredients a full life.
    ingredients:
    - Shichimi Salt, for rimming the glass
    - Lime wedge, for rimming the glass
    - 1½ ounces Olmeca Altos Plata tequila
    - 1 ounce Tutti-Fruity Cordial
    - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ½ ounce ruby port wine
    - 1 cup crushed ice
    - "Garnish: seasonal fruit"
    steps:
    - Rim half a double old-fashioned glass with shichimi salt. Combine the tequila, cordial, lime juice and crushed ice in a heavy-duty blender and blend until the mixture has a silky, slushy consistency. Pour into the prepared glass and float the ruby port on top. Garnish with seasonal fruit.

#Boilermakers
  - name: Fancy Ramune
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: Ramune is an iconic lemon-lime soda in Japan that for me brings up very nostalgic feelings about summer festivals of long ago and coming home. To this day, it comes in a cool bottle with a glass marble stuck in the top of the neck that you have to push down in order to sip the soda. The flavor profile of Ramune was our inspiration here, only we make a very fancy version from scratch. It is a bit of a lemon-drop-meets-sake-bomb, pairing Other Half Forever Ever IPA, which is an unfiltered, zesty and dry style of American IPA, with a chilled shot of our house Lemon-Daiginjo made with Dassai 50 junmai daiginjo sake and lemon sherbet for a refreshing take on a shandy.
    ingredients:
    - 16 ounces Other Half Forever Ever IPA (or another local citrusy IPA)
    - 1 shot chilled Lemon-Daiginjo 
    steps:
    - Serve the IPA in a pint glass accompanied by a chilled shot of Lemon-Daiginjo.

    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: The name is a play on “hair of the dog” (or dragon or tiger, as I’m sure you have heard many variations out there, if you are prone to overindulging), that spirited tradition of having a morning-after pick-me-up of whatever you were drinking the night before that got you into your current predicament. We pair Sixpoint Brewery Alpenflo lager with Cat Bran, our own take on the famed Denki Bran from Tokyo’s historic Kamiya Bar. To make Cat Bran, we infuse American brandy with spices, including juniper berries, cinnamon, and black cardamom. Denki Bran is around 25% ABV and the brandy is 50%, so we bring down the latter’s proof with a mix of teas—chamomile, Assam, strawberry, and mint—and add a bit of sugar. The tea and spices all work well together, and the lager has a tea undertone. But best of all, when I serve it, I get to tell the Denki Bran story and explain Kamiya Bar’s important role in Japanese cocktail history.
    ingredients:
    - 16 ounces Sixpoint Brewery Alpenflo lager
    - 1 shot chilled Cat Bran
    steps:
    - Serve the lager in a pint glass accompanied by a chilled shot of Cat Bran.

    notes: Ichi-Mas is, by far, our number one bestselling boilermaker. The name is a made-up phrase coined by Naren Young, my American bartending sensei. Ichi means “one” in Japanese and mas is “more” in Spanish, so essentially it means “one more.” We pair a frigid shot of Suntory Toki whisky from the highball machine with a watermelon slice seasoned with shichimi salt. This harkens back to my days at The Daily, which had a drink on the menu called the Soup du Jour. It consisted of a whiskey that changed on a daily basis and was served neat in a rocks glass with an orange or watermelon slice on the side. Our fruit-topped shot is accompanied by an icy can of Sapporo beer. Guests take the shot of whisky and a bite of the cold watermelon, followed by a guzzle of cold beer.
    ingredients:
    - 1 shot cold Suntory Toki whisky
    - Shichimi salt
    - Watermelon slice
    - 1 can Sapporo beer, chilled

    notes: This boilermaker is very close to my heart and is my homage to the late John Lermayer, a charismatic bartending legend who put Miami firmly on the craft cocktail map while bringing each one of us in this industry closer together. It was the first drink that I conceptualized for Katana Kitten’s menu, and we were going to spring it on John when he came to see our bar opening, as he always liked surprises. We got the news of his sudden passing at age forty-five while we were training Katana Kitten’s bar team at Boilermaker, our sister bar. There are so many times that we find ourselves doing fun things and making memorable nights at Katana Kitten and wishing that John could have experienced them in person. The pairing is John’s classic Bubble Back, a shot of tequila chased by Champagne, Krug specifically. Greg Boehm, on behalf of Katana Kitten, set up a college fund for John’s son, Radek, and all proceeds from sales of this drink go to the fund. John’s legacy will live on for a long time in our small bar in the West Village. Serves four.
    ingredients:
    - ½ bottle Krug Grande Cuvée Champagne
    - 4 shots Olmeca Altos Plata tequila
    - Seasonal fruit
    steps:
    - Fill a large cypress bowl with crushed ice. On top of the ice, arrange the 1/2 bottle of Krug, the four shots of tequila, and the seasonal fruits as garnishes.

    notes: This pairing is for my friend Max Warner, who represented Chivas Regal for more than a decade as its global brand ambassador. I was absolutely privileged to get to know him after I won the Chivas Masters global cocktail competition in 2014. I’m grateful for memories of spending a great deal of time with him in Tokyo and many different parts of the world. He has long inspired me, both as a bartender and as someone who knows how to entertain guests with ease. The spirit we use here is Chivas Regal 18, which happens to be a favorite of many bartenders. Given that it is a very rich whisky with notes of apple and dried fruit, it goes really well with cider. We pair the shot with seasonal ciders from Downeast Cider House. During the summer, we serve their Aloha Fridays, a pineapple cider. In winter, we switch to their Winter Spice cider. Our guests at Katana Kitten love this pairing year round.
    ingredients:
    - 1 shot Chivas Regal 18
    - 12 ounces Downeast Cider House cider, chilled
    steps:
    - Serve the shot of Chivas Regal accompanied by a glass of the cider.

#With a Little Help From My Friends
  - name: Agua Verde
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This phrase means “green water” in Spanish, and the inspiration of this cocktail is agua fresca, a traditional Mexican soft drink. Living in New York City introduced me to Mexican culture and its rich culinary traditions. Visiting Mexico rocket-charged my love and respect for their flavors, as did the discovery of the large colorful glass jars containing a variety of freshly made aguas frescas. For a Japanese spin, I added shishito peppers, which are served grilled in just about every yakitori restaurant and izakaya in Japan. They have become ubiquitous in New York City restaurants in recent years as well. These small peppers are concentrated with a bright green flavor and bring a vibrant color that lends the cocktail its name. I moved to New York City in 2008 and noticed a certain trend among restaurants, with particular vegetables gaining huge popularity and seeming to pop up on every menu across town. This happened with cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and, of course, kale. We recently experienced a shishito pepper bonanza, and I was quite happy about it.
    ingredients:
    - Matcha Salt, for rimming the glass
    - Lime wedge, for rimming the glass
    - 1 ounce Montelobos mezcal joven
    - ½ ounce Iichiko Saiten shochu
    - 1 barspoon Italicus Rosolio di Bergamotto bergamot liqueur
    - 5 ounces Kabosu Lemonade
    - ¼ ounce fresh shishito pepper juice
    - Pinch of sea salt
    - "Garnish: chargrilled shishito pepper"
    steps:
    - Rim half of a pilsner glass with matcha salt. Build the cocktail in the prepared glass by adding the mezcal, shochu, bergamot liqueur, and lemonade over ice. Stir until chilled. Float the shishito pepper juice and salt over the top of the cocktail. Garnish with a chargrilled shishito pepper.

    notes: This cocktail takes its cues from hot toddies and mulled wine and is based on shochu, Japan’s national spirit. While oyuwari, namely mixing with hot water, is a popular way to enjoy shochu back home, I use a mulled wine to add a festive note to the drink. Aka means “red” in Japanese and reminds me of the autumn leaves in my hometown. Drinking this while watching the animated Japanese TV series Five Rangers that we all enjoyed growing up brings back a lot of countryside memories.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Yamasemi rice shochu
    - ¼ ounce crème de cassis
    - ¼ ounce Rich Honey Syrup
    - 1 dash Sangostura Bitters
    - Hot Jasmine Mulled Wine
    - "Garnish: star anise pod"
    steps:
    - In a Japanese teacup, combine the shochu, crème de cassis, honey syrup, and bitters. Top with hot mulled wine. Garnish with a star anise pod.

    notes: London bar phenom team Ryan Chetiyawardana and Iain Griffiths are known for venues that balance creativity and sustainability. The two, together with their global bar director Alex Lawrence, briefly graced New York City with an elaborate across-the-pond pop-up of Lyaness, the bold concept that succeeded the globally acclaimed Dandelyan. I was delighted that Iain Griffiths invited me to do a guest shift and created this cocktail for the occasion. I called it Anbai, which is grandma talk for creating the perfect balance of taste, whether by adding a pinch of salt or a smidgen of sugar. The base of the cocktail is Empirical Spirits Onyx; developed in collaboration with Lyaness, this unique koji-based spirit also incorporates hibiscus and birchwood kombucha. To provide its vibrant scarlet color, I use red shiso, which is a traditional culinary colorant in Japan. With a bit of citrus acidity, it literally turns bright purple-red. This particular umeshu is based on sake and is muto, meaning it contains no added sugar, which delivers the aromatic acidity of the plum. A touch of special mezcal adds a hint of earthiness that puts this cocktail over the top.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Empirical Spirits Onyx Blend
    - 1 ounce Red Shiso Tea
    - 1 ounce Nanbu Bijin Muto umeshu plum sake
    - 1 barspoon Del Maguey Tobalá mezcal
    - "Garnish: lemon twist and shio kombu (seasoned Japanese kelp)"
    steps:
    - Fill an old-fashioned glass with ice. Build the drink by adding the Empirical Spirits Onyx Blend, tea, sake, and mezcal. Express a lemon twist over the drink and discard, then garnish with shio kombu.

    notes: Azusa is the name of our precious daughter, my little pride and joy. While Azusa is also the inspiration behind this cocktail, it’s actually a popular traditional name in Japan, in addition to being the name of a Japanese cherry birch tree with beautiful white flowers that blossom each spring. In Nagano, there are many azusa trees, and the train that passes through there from Tokyo is named the Azusa Express, which is quite poetic. The drink itself is my version of the cosmopolitan, the cocktail that was first perfected and popularized by Toby Cecchini during his tenure at Odeon in the late 1980s. In this version, instead of using cranberry juice, the color and tartness of fresh cranberries are added to aquavit via sous vide.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Cranberry Sous-Vide Aquavit
    - ½ ounce Reisetbauer apple eau-de-vie
    - ¾ ounce Combier liqueur
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce simple syrup

    notes: This drink, my version of a Manhattan, came about by kicking around ideas with my partner in crime, Nacho. What makes it stand out is its clear color, which is completely unexpected for a cocktail that usually has a deep mahogany tone. I did this by subbing out the usual bourbon or rye whiskey for unaged whiskey and genever. It is still a rich and luxurious sip. Suze, a gentian-forward French herbal liqueur, balances the sweetness with earthy bitterness and adds a beautiful yellow hue. It’s named after the Brooklyn neighborhood where my wife, Taryn, and I first lived together.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce George Dickel No. 1 white corn whisky
    - 1 ounce Old Duff genever single malt
    - 1 ounce Dolin Blanc vermouth
    - ½ ounce Suze gentiane liqueur
    - 1 barspoon Luxardo maraschino liqueur
    - 3 dashes yuzu bitters

    notes: This is a summertime highball variation that I created for High West Distillery, a whiskey producer in Park City, Utah, that I admire for its wonderful blended whiskeys, especially their peaty Campfire expression. Sometimes with whiskey, I notice there are tropical notes, and I chose to highlight this quality by creating a cocktail with passion fruit and yuzu. I added vermouth to lighten its body, and the coconut rim further amplifies these tropical notes, imparted by aging in American oak barrels.
    ingredients:
    - Coconut Salt, for rimming the glass
    - Lemon wedge, for rimming the glass
    - 1 ounce High West Campfire whiskey
    - 1 ounce Dolin Blanc vermouth
    - ¾ ounce Passion Fruit-Yuzu Sour Mix
    - Fever-Tree Sparkling Lemon
    - "Garnish: Coconut Salt and dehydrated lemon slice"
    steps:
    - Rim a highball glass with coconut salt. Combine the whiskey, vermouth, and sour mix in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake and strain into a highball glass over an ice spear or stack of ice cubes. Top with sparkling lemonade and gently stir. Garnish with coconut salt and dehydrated lemon slice.

    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: I named this cocktail after the famous mountains that lie between Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures. They are called the Yatsugatake, meaning “eight peaks,” referring to the major mountains in the range that climbers try to summit. In this lower-ABV aperitif, I split the base between umeshu and Lillet Rouge infused with Lapsang Souchong tea. The tea’s origin is a mountainous region of China, where it is dried, fermented, and smoked over pinewood fires in baskets, and it imbues the cocktail with a rich, piney, and smoky note.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Choya umeshu
    - 1 ounce Lapsang Souchong Tea-Infused Lillet Rouge
    - Soda water, chilled

    notes: This vermouth highball variation has its origins in the time I spent working behind the bar together with Nacho at The Daily. We would peruse old cocktail books and experiment with recipes, and one of our favorite creations was housemade vermouth, which is essentially aromatized wine. We found out that it is really not difficult to make from scratch. We wanted something hyper-local, so we used a dry Riesling from New York’s Finger Lakes region. From our community garden in Brooklyn Heights, I harvested wormwood, lavender, and rose petals, to which I added coriander seeds, citrus zests, and other botanicals. These were combined with the wine and allowed to macerate for about a week. Once the botanicals were strained out, we added sugar and a bit of apple eau-de-vie from upstate New York to fortify and preserve it. I recommend storing it refrigerated all the time, as you would with any wine.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Homemade Vermouth
    - 4 ounces Doc’s Draft hard pear cider
    - "Garnish: fresh herbs and lemon twist"

    notes: With its name meaning “grasshopper” in Japanese, this variation on the classic dessert cocktail of the same name is amped up by a full-bodied American bourbon, along with a hint of smoke from an Islay single malt whisky. While still taking the balance and identity of this drink from the Grasshopper, this cocktail is built based on my sense memory of the rice harvest season in Minowa. Kinako sugar brings a sweet, malty aroma that reminds me of milling rice husks, and the peatiness of the Scotch conjures the burning of dry hay in the fields.
    ingredients:
    - Bowmore 18-year-old single malt Scotch whisky
    - Kinako Sugar
    - ½ ounce Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon
    - 1 ounce Giffard crème de châtaigne
    - 1 ounce Giffard crème de cacao
    - 1½ ounces half-and-half

  - name: Japanese Highball
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: When you order a highball in Japan, it is universally implied that you are ordering a whisky highball. The drink is very personal, and this is how I prefer making them at home. In Japan, after a long day’s work, people head to their local bar or izakaya and order beer and whisky highballs. This is a great pairing with the Izakaya’s fried and salty snacks, which beg for a refreshing accompaniment. Moreover, at around $5 a pop, it is completely democratic and popular across all demographics. My version is the Platonic ideal of simplicity and deliciousness. The trick is to keep your Japanese whisky in the freezer and your seltzer in the fridge. While at the bar we obsess about ice, ordinary store-bought bagged ice will do just fine here. If your whisky is room temperature, stir it over the ice to bring it down in temperature. If it is coming from the freezer, as I prefer, stir it to raise the temperature and make the spirit amenable to proper dilution. Then add whatever fizzy water you have on hand, provided it is straight from the fridge. The drink takes literally seconds to throw together and enjoy. It is great as an aperitif, a meal accompaniment, or just for kicking back and watching the game or a movie. Kanpai!
    ingredients:
    - Suntory Kakubin, strategically stored in the home freezer (feel free to substitute your favorite whisky)

  - name: Kahlúa Milk Punch
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This is a very complex and flavorful punch that I created originally for a StarChefs event in New York City. So if you find yourself entertaining a large group of friends or family, this is something you take your time to prepare in advance, but it is well worth the effort. My inspiration was my youth in Japan, when Kahlúa and milk was everyone’s favorite drink. This version is a take on Mary Rockett’s classic clarified milk punch, which has the sophistication, complexity, and finesse of each ingredient through maceration. The recipe was brought to my attention in Dave Wondrich’s definitive book on the flowing bowl, Punch. This perfectly clear punch has a long mixological heritage and was a way to preserve milk by removing the proteins and fat solids that would otherwise spoil. The fact that it has a good alcoholic kick as a further preservative makes it irresistible to cocktail fans. The technique is finding renewed popularity today, as it creates a symphony of flavors that are perfectly melded together. I chose as my base a Highland Scotch whisky with classic Speyside rich malt sweetness and spice from sherry cask aging. Aged rum adds a roundness to the flavor and also brings baking spice aromas, like vanilla and cinnamon, from resting in American oak barrels. The milk emulsifies all the ingredients and smooths out any edges to the alcohol. To create the maximum intensity of coffee flavor, I use dark roasted espresso beans, as well as Kahlúa. Lastly, tamari adds a savory note that complements its sweetness, like sprinkling a bit of salt into hot chocolate. Makes two quarts, or twenty servings.
    ingredients:
    - ¾ cup sugar
    - 1¼ cups brewed coffee, hot
    - 1½ cups Aberlour 12-year-old single malt Scotch whisky
    - 1½ cups Bacardí Reserva Ocho rum
    - 6 ounces Kahlúa coffee liqueur
    - 5 ounces fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce tamari
    - 2 tablespoons cocoa nibs
    - 2 tablespoons whole coffee beans
    - 2 cups whole milk
    - Zest of 1 lemon, cut into strips with a peeler or paring knife
    - "Garnish: 3 coffee beans and grated nutmeg for each serving"
    steps:
    - In a large bowl, stir together the sugar and the hot coffee to dissolve the sugar. Let cool, then stir in the whisky, rum, Kahlúa, lemon juice, and tamari. In a saucepan, toast the cocoa nibs and coffee beans over medium-low heat, continuously moving the pan, for about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool. Add the milk and lemon zest to the saucepan and slowly bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Remove from the heat and add the whisky mixture. Stir well, and allow to cool, then rest overnight in the fridge. Strain the mixture through cheesecloth into 2-quart container, squeezing the cheesecloth to extract all the liquid. Strain through a doubled coffee filter into a 2-quart bottle. The mixture should be perfectly clear, but there might be some sediment on the bottle. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
    - To serve, pour the punch into a brandy snifter over ice and stir. Garnish with 3 coffee beans and grated nutmeg.

    notes: The inspiration for this cocktail is a classic drink from New Orleans, the Sazerac, which is very spirit-forward. In keeping with its provenance, I wanted to use exclusively American spirits. To give it a Japanese flair, I call for a fresh yuzu twist. Yuzu is traditionally available in fall and winter, but it is now grown in California. At around $3 for a small fruit, its aromatic zest is incomparable. Kakinoki means “persimmon tree” in Japanese. Back home in Minowa, there is an abundance of these trees behind our family home and on the hillside of the nearby mountains. My grandma used to pick persimmons to prepare hoshi gaki, which consisted of the fruit being peeled, smoked, and dried in long rows outside, creating a picturesque orange curtain.
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ ounces Bertoux brandy
    - 1¼ ounces Old Overholt rye whiskey
    - ½ ounce Apologue Persimmon bittersweet liqueur
    - 1 barspoon date syrup
    - 3 dashes Sangostura Bitters

    notes: Fall is one of my favorite seasons, and I wanted to include a drink that embodies the overall sensation of autumn. My mind immediately raced to kurumi, which are Japanese walnuts that lend the cocktail its name. As the leaves turn with the season, the walnuts fall from the trees, and people happily gather them up. I have many fond memories of my grandma sitting beside a big pile of walnuts, carefully cracking them open and harvesting the lovely nut within, which she transformed into a beautiful sauce for mochi (rice cakes). The cocktail itself is my take on the classic Japanese cocktail that was included in Jerry Thomas’s 1862 book How to Mix Drinks, or The Bon-Vivant’s Companion. Ironically, there is nothing specifically Japanese about the Japanese cocktail, except its back story. Cocktail historian and friend of the bar David Wondrich theorizes that the drink was created to celebrate a visit by Japan’s first diplomatic mission to the US following the opening of Japan. The delegation found friendly refuge in Thomas’s bar and was led by Tateishi “Tommy” Onojirou Noriyuki, who earned quite a reputation as a bon vivant. In my version of this simple cocktail, I stay true to the classic with a Cognac base. Walnuts are incorporated into a lovely orgeat syrup and the cocktail’s pleasing nuttiness is further amplified with pecan bitters.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal Cognac
    - ½ ounce Kurumi Orgeat
    - 3 dashes Miracle Mile toasted pecan bitters
    - "Garnish: lemon twist"

    notes: After winning the Chivas Master global cocktail competition, I was fortunate to travel with the brand and judge regional finals in many countries, including Japan. The best part was that I got to spend time with my good friend Max Warner, Chivas’s global brand ambassador and an all-around awesome guy. When we were judging Japanese regional finals in Tokyo, I was asked to create a drink for the competing bartenders to enjoy. My inspiration came from two New York City bars. The first was Dante, with its take on the Garibaldi, a classic combination of Campari and ultra-fluffy orange juice. The second was the Horse’s Apple at the now departed Suffolk Arms, with the guest’s choice of spirit, freshly pressed Granny Smith apple juice and freshly grated horseradish. My creation marries Chivas 18 with “fluffy” Fuji apple juice. You can only get this texture using a Breville juicer. Like a highball, it is an extremely simple drink, so texture, temperature, and perfect ingredients are paramount. The Chivas is beautiful, with its signature apple and stone fruit notes, with eighteen years describing the youngest whiskies in the blend that also contains much older ones. The fresh Fuji apple juice amplifies the sweetness of the malt and adds refreshing acidity as well. The buckwheat honey syrup gives roundness to the drink.
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ ounces Chivas Regal 18
    - ¼ ounce Buckwheat Honey Syrup
    - Fresh Fuji apple juice
    - "Garnish: freshly grated cinnamon"

    notes: Hokkaido is Japan’s most northern island, a stone’s throw from Russia, and is famous for its fertile land and seafood, several national parks, and ski resorts. But did you know it is also home to a beloved regional dish, miso butter corn ramen? Just like it sounds, it consists of your basic ramen noodles swimming in a miso broth that is enriched with corn kernels and a fat pat of butter that quickly melts and coats the entire surface. It is absolutely delicious, and I wanted to give a sense of it in a cocktail. I use Mellow Corn, a straight corn whiskey from Heaven Hill Distillery. The whiskey is fat-washed with butter to capture the round mouthfeel and give it a nuanced creamy flavor. White miso enters the picture, along with crème fraîche. Finally, I incorporate a corn puree made from rehydrated freeze-dried corn kernels. These have an intense corn flavor and allow for consistent results year-round. Of course, if it’s the height of corn season, feel free to use a roasted sweet puree of fresh corn kernels instead.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Salted Butter-Washed Whiskey
    - ¾ ounce Cornsilk Syrup
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice

    notes: Myoga Fixserves oneThis is my take on a classic Gin Daisy cocktail using myoga, a kind of Japanese ginger sprout with a distinctly refreshing flavor. My grandparents cultivated myoga in their garden, and every year, in the spring, it would shoot up flowering buds that we would harvest together, as needed. Traditionally, the buds, which are ruddy bronze on the outside and white within, are finely cut into slivers and are used as a condiment, adorning miso soup, soba noodles, and other dishes. It has a delicate, ginger-like spiciness. In this cocktail, fresh myoga gets muddled, and its herbaceous quality is ramped up with the addition of yellow Chartreuse, which is the defining modifier of the cocktail.
    ingredients:
    - ½ fresh myoga bud
    - ¼ ounce simple syrup
    - 1½ ounces Suntory Roku gin
    - ¾ ounce Combier liqueur

    notes: Sometimes cocktails are inspired by savory dishes, and other times by desserts. This cocktail is a fun take on a margarita and takes its cues from a classic Japanese dessert called zunda-mochi. It is comprised of mochi (rice cakes) topped with savory and sweet edamame sauce. Most people are familiar with edamame steamed or boiled with sea salt that is served in restaurants and are surprised that the humble legume is also used in desserts. In zunda, the edamame are cooked with water, mashed, and sweetened to make a sauce. In this cocktail, the edamame forms the base of our silky pale green syrup. As the drink’s foundation, I chose Milk-Washed Tequila, which adds a creamy, round mouthfeel and accounts for the “whey” in the drink’s name. Amazake, a kind of no-alcohol sake, adds a hint of sweetness.
    ingredients:
    - Lime Salt, for rimming the glass
    - Lime wedge, for rimming the glass
    - 1½ ounce Milk-Washed Tequila
    - ½ ounce amazake (a kind of no-alcohol sake)
    - ¾ ounce Zunda Syrup
    - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
    - "Garnish: pea shoot"
    steps:
    - Rim a quarter of a rocks glass with the lime salt. Combine the tequila, amazake, syrup, and lime juice in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until chilled and fine-strain over fresh ice into a rocks glass. Garnish with a pea shoot.

    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: "The name of this cocktail refers to pineapple, the juice of which is prominently featured, and sensei (mentor), in this case, Naren Young, who introduced me to numerous classic cocktails. It is a cross between two historic drinks: the Algonquin, where the dry spice of rye whiskey is complemented by luscious fresh pineapple and herbaceous vermouth, and the East India Cocktail #2, with Cognac, fresh pineapple juice, orange curaçao, and maraschino liqueur. In this version, I use unaged, clear Armagnac, which conveys its vibrant grape base, as well as vermouth that features sakura (cherry blossoms) as one of its botanicals. I amp it up with Salted Sakura Syrup, which adds a touch of salinity."
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Château de Pellehaut Blanche d’Armagnac
    - ¾ ounce Mancino Sakura vermouth
    - 1½ ounces fresh pineapple juice
    - ½ ounce Salted Sakura Syrup
    - ¼ ounce Luxardo maraschino liqueur
    steps:
    - Combine the armagnac, vermouth, pineapple juice, sakura syrup, and maraschino liqueur in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake vigorously until chilled, then strain into a large coupe.

  - name: Sakura Julep
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: "As a huge fan of bourbon, I wanted to create a cocktail grounded in the classics that nods to Japan. This is a traditional Mint Julep variation. Peaches grow abundantly in the South, and are celebrated in many local drinks and dishes. Meanwhile, Nagano is famous for its stone fruits, including peaches (momo), plums, ume, and apricots. For this recipe, I use bourbon, a smidgen of peach liqueur, mint, and sugar. To this, I add an oleo-saccharum perfumed by preserved sakura (cherry blossom) leaves. They add a distinct herbaceousness and salinity that go well with the bourbon, and a touch of ginger acts as a bridge between the spirit and the peach flavor. Pro tip: Instead of muddling the mint leaves, rub them on the inside surface of the julep cup to really extract their fragrant essence."
    ingredients:
    - 8 to 10 fresh mint leaves
    - 2 ounces bourbon
    - ¼ ounce peach liqueur
    - ½ ounce Sakura Leaf Oleo-Saccharum
    - 1 barspoon Rich Ginger Syrup
    - "Garnish: mint sprig bouquet"
    steps:
    - Take the mint leaves, rub the inside of a julep cup, and leave them on the bottom. Add the bourbon, peach liqueur, oleo-saccharum, and syrup, fill the cup halfway with crushed ice, and stir to combine. Top off with more crushed ice and garnish with abundant sprigs of mint formed into a bouquet.

  - name: Truffle Old-Fashioned
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This cocktail is based on a drink that I made at Saxon + Parole, but I have tweaked it here by adding Japanese whisky and matsutake mushrooms. For the cocktail’s foundation, I use Hibiki Japanese Harmony whisky, another beautiful expression from Suntory. It has elegant notes of oak and honey, which I thought would be nicely complemented by earthy mushrooms. I chose matsutake, a sought-after seasonal delicacy that grows at the feet of red pine trees and is incredibly fragrant. Many people compare them to porcinis. For this cocktail, I make a syrup that mixes these two exquisite mushrooms. To amplify the fungi quotient even further, I add the delectable flavor of truffles to the whisky and simply garnish the drink with a slice of Italian black truffle.
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Truffle Butter-Washed Whisky
    - ¼ ounce Matsutake-Porcini Syrup
    - 3 dashes chocolate bitters
    - Pinch of truffle salt
    - "Garnish: freshly shaved black truffle slice"
    steps:
    - Combine the whisky, syrup, bitters, and truffle salt in a mixing glass with ice. Stir until chilled and strain into an old-fashioned glass over a large cube of ice. Garnish with a freshly shaved black truffle slice.

  - name: Umeshu Soda
    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This drink makes use of umeshu, which many Japanese families prepare at home as part of a seasonal tradition, like my grandma did. Most commonly, umeshu’s base is white liquor, which is basically a column still-produced shochu. This version is just like my grandma used to make, down to the exact proportions and techniques, but uses a Highland blanco tequila as a base. The spirit’s tropical, fruity, and herbaceous notes nicely amplify the fresh aromatics of the ume without overpowering them. In a highball, this Nagano-meets-Jalisco mixture makes for a crushable summertime cooler, whether by the pool or on the edge of a rice paddy.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Homemade Umeshu
    - Soda water, chilled
    - "Garnish: lime twist"
    steps:
    - Pour the umeshu into a highball glass filled with ice. Top with chilled soda water and gently stir. Garnish with a lime twist.

    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: This is a punch that I created and have served at numerous charity events during my time in New York City. It is a crowd-pleaser that is ideal for parties and can be prepared ahead of time, with a big block of ice added just before serving. The inspiration here is the Bamboo cocktail, which is powered by dry vermouth and dry sherry. Bamboo is, of course, very Japanese and, growing up in a valley, the mountains behind our house were surrounded by stalks of wild bamboo. As a child, you learn how to fold bamboo leaves into little boats and then drop them in local streams, where you can follow them for miles. The drink’s name pays homage to this memory.
    ingredients:
    - 3 tablespoons Lime Oleo-Saccharum
    - 6 ounces fresh lime juice
    - 6 ounces Bacardí Carta Blanca rum
    - 2 ounces Noilly Prat extra dry vermouth
    - 2 ounces Manzanilla sherry
    - 2 ounces St-Germain elderflower liqueur
    - 4 ounces Honeydew-Daiginjo Sherbet 
    - 10 ounces cold brewed sencha green tea
    - Splash of dry sparkling wine
    - "Garnish: cucumber slices, lime slices, bamboo leaves, and freshly grated nutmeg"
    steps:
    - In a punch bowl, dissolve the oleo-saccharum in the lime juice. Add the rum, vermouth, sherry, elderflower liqueur, sherbet, and tea along with a large block of ice. Top with a splash of dry sparkling wine. Garnish individual servings with cucumber and lime slices, bamboo leaves, and freshly grated nutmeg.

    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: During the Meiji Dynasty and the Taishō era, Western culture, including its fashions, began filtering into the Japanese mainstream, with men’s shirts featuring starched “high collars,” which stood out in kimono-clad Japan. Over time, high collar, or haikara in Japanese, came to represent anything modern, Western, and trendy. My drink is a contemporary nonalcoholic version of an old-fashioned. This classic cocktail is traditionally whisk(e)y-based and in its place, I use charcoal-roasted barley tea, as malted barley is often part of a spirit’s mash bill. This robustly flavored tea works as the structure of the drink, with Lapsang Souchong tea adding a peaty note. I add vanilla and bitters to simulate the effect of barrel aging.
    ingredients:
    - 3 ounces Charcoal-Roasted Barley and Lapsang Souchong Tea 
    - ½ ounce Vanilla Syrup 
    - 3 dashes Angostura bitters
    - "Garnish: orange twist"
    steps:
    - Build the drink in a double rocks glass by adding the tea, syrup, and bitters over hand-carved ice. Stir until chilled. Garnish with an orange twist.

    author: Masahiro Urushido
    notes: In the years following the end of World War II, many ordinary Japanese couldn’t afford to enjoy beer on a daily basis. In its place was Hoppy, a nonalcoholic malt beverage, to which tipplers added their own spirit, like shochu, to obtain a “close enough” version of beer. Hoppy is seeing a revival today in Japan, as some believe it is healthier than regular beer, since it contains no purines, and shochu is considered a very clean distillate. While I won’t venture a medical opinion, I’m a fan of Hoppy for its nostalgic taste. This is a nonalcoholic shandy with Hopped Yuzu Sherbet. Quaffable and sessionable, it showcases Cascade hops’ refreshing nose, which pairs well with the uniquely zesty yuzu citrus.
    ingredients:
    - ¾ ounce Hopped Yuzu Sherbet 
    - 1½ ounces water, chilled
    - Hoppy (or substitute any nonalcoholic beer), for topping
    - "Garnish: yuzu wheel"
    steps:
    - Fill a collins glass with ice. Add the sherbet and water and stir until chilled. Top with Hoppy and gently stir. Garnish with a yuzu wheel.

    author: Naren Young
    notes: This cocktail is an Asian-inspired take on the gimlet, courtesy of Naren Young, formerly creative director of the highly acclaimed New York City restaurant bar Dante and its sister bar, Dante West Village. It is a study in simplicity, with bold fresh flavors and a hint of spice from wasabi. Naren, one of my esteemed sensei, splits the base down the middle between gin and shochu and creates his own cordial with housemade Salted Lime Syrup and yuzu juice. The gimlet originally has its roots in the British Navy, where a daily dose of lime juice was prescribed to prevent scurvy, and the enterprising sailors took it upon themselves to improve its flavor by mixing in their daily ration of gin.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce gin
    - 1 ounce shochu
    - ¾ ounce Salted Lime Syrup
    - ½ ounce yuzu juice
    - Pinch of wasabi powder or paste
    - ½ teaspoon rice vinegar
    - "Garnish: fresh shiso leaf"
    steps:
    - Combine the shochu, syrup, yuzu juice, wasabi powder or paste, and vinegar in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until chilled and double-strain into a frozen coupe. Garnish with a fresh shiso leaf.

    notes: This fragrant and refreshing cocktail was created by my good friend, Kenta Goto, the owner of Bar Goto in New York City, Pegu Club alum, and winner of “American Bartender of the Year” at 2011 Tales of the Cocktail. The foundation of this cocktail is the Mojito, the famed Cuban cocktail redolent with rum and mint. A gin-based Mojito is called a Southside, so this cocktail, with a sake base, earns the clever moniker the Far East Side. The fact that it is sake-based lowers the ABV, with tequila acting in a supporting role.
    ingredients:
    - 3 fresh shiso leaves
    - 2 ounces sake
    - ¾ ounce elderflower liqueur
    - ½ ounce tequila
    - ¼ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - "Garnish: fresh shiso leaf"
    steps:
    - Muddle the shiso leaves in a mixing glass. Add the sake, elderflower liqueur, tequila, and lemon juice with ice. Stir until chilled and strain into a Nick & Nora glass. Garnish with a fresh shiso leaf.

    notes: A lower-ABV Manhattan was the inspiration for this cocktail by Natasha David, a Lower East Side bar luminary. Rather than a spirit foundation, it taps Japanese umeshu, a plum liqueur that, in this case, is made with sake rather than shochu, creating a less potent tipple. This note is further amplified by a splash of French plum brandy. Bourbon comes in as a modifier and gives this refined floral sipper a bit more of a backbone.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Kakurei junmai ginjo sake umeshu (or substitute another sake-based umeshu)
    - 1½ ounces Cocchi Rosa
    - ½ ounce Wild Turkey 101 bourbon
    - 1 teaspoon Trimbach Mirabelle plum brandy
    - "Garnish: brandied cherry"

The Arigato Sour’s pink color and bracing kabosu citrus note make it a perfect aperitif cocktail.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Suntory Toki whisky
    - ½ ounce Greenhook Ginsmiths beach plum gin liqueur
    - ½ ounce St-Germain elderflower liqueur
    - 1 ounce kabosu juice
    - ½ ounce simple syrup
    - 1 ounce egg white
    - "Garnish: edible blueberry-lemon sorbet violet flower (available online)"

    notes: For this cocktail, world-renowned Japanese bartender and bar owner Shingo Gokan, the force behind The SG Club in Tokyo and Shanghai’s Speak Low, Sober Company, and the Odd Couple, took as his inspiration the Hinomaru bento box. Consisting of simple and humble white rice crowned with a single umeboshi (pickled plum) placed in the center, it represents the ultimate minimalist presentation and also suggests the Japanese flag with the red circle on a white background. To construct the drink, Shingo turns to a rice shochu to represent the white of the flag and a single ume to symbolize the rising sun. He adds a touch of umeshu (plum liqueur) and a spray of saline to re-create the sensation of the umeboshi.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce The SG Club Kome shochu (or substitute any rice shochu)
    - 1 ounce umeshu (plum liqueur)
    - 1 dash Peychaud’s bitters
    - 2 dashes rice vinegar

    author: Erick Castro
    notes: This cocktail, a twist on the Red Hook, which is itself a Brooklyn variation of the classic Manhattan, was created by Erick Castro, the renowned West Coast bar star. In his drink, sesame-infused Japanese whisky takes the place of rye, with ginger liqueur and Marsala wine replacing maraschino liqueur and Punt e Mes. Its feline name is rooted in history and politics, of which Erick is a keen student. He’s long been fascinated with samurai, Japan’s feudal military caste that was governed by Bushido (the Way of the Warrior), a code that prized honor and loyalty, and dictated nearly all areas of a samurai’s life. During times of political intrigue or upheaval, it would sometimes be necessary to engage in clandestine techniques and tactics, such as spying, espionage, and assassinations. However, this behavior was seen as contravening Bushido. A practical workaround was that the katana-wielding samurai would use ninjas (mercenary martial artists and saboteurs) as their proxies to do their bidding. Since ninjas were typically of a lower caste than samurai and not held to the standards of Bushido, these “dishonorable” tactics could be employed without fear of shame. Having others do one’s dirty work, as a cat’s paw does for the cat, goes back, no doubt, to the beginning of time, and there is no shortage of it today.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Sesame Oil-Washed Japanese Whisky
    - ¾ ounce ginger liqueur
    - ¾ ounce Madeira wine (or substitute Carpano Antica Formula vermouth)
    - 2 drops Kishibori Shoyu barrel-aged soy sauce 
    - "Garnish: 1 by 3-inch rectangle nori"
    steps:
    - Combine the whisky, ginger liqueur, Madeira, and soy sauce in a mixing glass with ice. Stir until chilled and pour into a soy sauce serving vessel. To serve, pour the contents over a large cube of ice in an old-fashioned glass. Garnish with a nori rectangle sitting atop the rim of the glass.

The bar’s shelves are bedecked with glass jars containing various experimental infusions and tinctures. The unexpected element in this Paloma variation is daikon, a large radish that is a key vegetable in traditional Japanese cuisine. But Hiroyasu breaks new ground by applying its juice in a refreshing and satisfying way.

    author: Jeff Bell
    notes: This cocktail was contributed by Jeff Bell, bar director of PDT, who earned “American Bartender of the Year” at 2017 Tales of the Cocktail and is a co-consulting master blender of Bertoux brandy. An elegant and handsome sipper, it is a Manhattan-style cocktail made with predominantly Japanese ingredients. There is a series of variations of this cocktail that are named for different parts of New York City, like Brooklyn, Little Italy, Bensonhurst, Greenpoint, and others. This Japan-centric variation is named for the Ginza district in Tokyo, where Jeff had his first introduction to the Japanese cocktail scene at the renowned Bar High Five and Star Bar. The cocktail employs Japanese whisky instead of the traditional bourbon or rye and swaps in sake and Drambuie for sweet vermouth. The sake is rather unique. It is a namazake, meaning it is unpasteurized, preserving its fresh flavors. But what sets this sake apart is that it is then aged for two years at a temperature near freezing. The resulting liquid is somewhat reminiscent of port wine or sherry. A bit of shio koji, a traditional Japanese seasoning, elevates the drink’s umami quotient.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Hibiki Japanese Harmony whisky
    - 1 ounce Kamoizumi red maple sake (or substitute a medium-bodied sake)
    - ¼ ounce Drambuie
    - 1 dash Angostura Bitters
    - 1 dash shio koji (available at Japanese markets and online)
    - "Garnish: star-shaped orange disc"
    steps:
    - Combine the whisky, sake, Drambuie, bitters, and shio koji in a mixing glass with ice. Stir until chilled and strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with a star-shaped orange disc.

It uses three key Japanese ingredients: rice milk, anko (sweetened red bean paste), and matcha."

    author: Mikey Belasco
    notes: This cocktail came to life behind the bar at the high-energy contemporary Indian restaurant GupShup, located in Manhattan’s Gramercy Park neighborhood. Created by bartender Mikey Belasco, its name is Hindi for a social club where members traditionally gather to gupshup (“gossip” in Hindi) and enjoy time away from home. Mikey wanted to create a drink that honors Japanese spirits, including rice-based vodka and two kinds of shochu, one at a traditional proof of 25% ABV and a higher one at 43% ABV to maximize the barley flavor notes. The mixture adds a different layer to the cocktail and complements the vodka. A small touch of Campari lends a little extra bitter note while adding color to complement the sweet and tart flavors of raspberry.
    ingredients:
    - 3 raspberries
    - ¾ ounce Suntory Haku vodka
    - ¼ ounce Iichiko Saiten shochu
    - ¼ ounce Iichiko Silhouette shochu
    - ¼ ounce Campari
    - ¼ ounce sweet vermouth
    - ¾ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce simple syrup
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - Ginger beer
    - "Garnish: lemon wheel and pineapple leaf"
    steps:
    - In a cocktail shaker, muddle the raspberries. Add the vodka, shochus, Campari, vermouth, lemon juice, simple syrup, and bitters with ice and shake until chilled. Strain into a collins glass over fresh ice and top with ginger beer. Garnish with a lemon wheel and a pineapple leaf.

    author: Gates Otsuji
    notes: This cocktail takes its name from the legendary katana-wielding samurai Hattori Hanzo, whose name was memorialized by Quentin Tarantino in Kill Bill. Its creator, Gates Otsuji, is the founder of Controlled Substances, a cocktail and beverage consultancy, and this martini variation exudes a wealth of subtle, delicately nuanced flavors. Gates’s inspiration was his Japanese grandmother’s goma (sesame) pickles, which were present at every family gathering. Here they are incorporated both in the glass and as a garnish. In this cocktail, he calls for “Mirror of Truth,” a lovely sake that dances gently across the palate, with a subtle grassy note to complement the fragrant botanicals of Beefeater 24 gin, especially Japanese sencha. The kombu, added to the pickling brine, provides enough umami to give heft to the cocktail and round out the edges on the palate.
    ingredients:
    - 2 Fresno chile slices
    - 1 drop sriracha (optional)
    - 2 ounces Beefeater 24 gin
    - 1 ounce Masumi Okuden Kantsukuri “Mirror of Truth” junmai sake
    - ½ ounce Dolin dry vermouth (or substitute Noilly Prat vermouth)
    - ½ ounce Goma Pickle Brine
    - 1 dash bergamot citrus puree (preferably Boiron)
    - "Garnish: slice of Goma Pickle"
    steps:
    - Gently crush the Fresno chile slices in a mixing glass and add a drop of sriracha, if desired. Add the gin, sake, vermouth, brine, and citrus puree and fill the glass with ice. Stir the drink to chill and fine-strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a goma pickle slice.

  - name: Highland Picnic
    author: Ignacio Jiminez
    notes: This drink was created by my dear comrade in arms, Nacho, creative director at Ghost Donkey. Highland refers here to the landscape of Jalisco, which is one of the most important tequila-producing regions in Mexico. I’ve learned so much from Nacho over the years and, in turn, was privileged to introduce him to Japanese ingredients, like yuzu and shiso, which are celebrated in this drink.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Montelobos mezcal
    - 1 ounce Olmeca Altos Plata tequila
    - ½ ounce yuzu juice
    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ½ ounce Shiso Syrup
    - ½ ounce agave syrup (1:1 agave nectar to water)
    - 1 egg white
    - "Garnish: yukari and half of a dehydrated orange wheel"
    steps:
    - Combine the mezcal, tequila, yuzu juice, lime juice, shiso syrup, agave syrup, and egg white in a cocktail shaker and dry shake without ice. Add ice and shake until chilled, then strain into a large coupe. Garnish with a sprinkle of yukari on the top and half of a dehydrated orange wheel.

  - name: Jazz Lingo
    author: Brian Evans
    notes: Brian Evans, Bar Director at Sunday in Brooklyn in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, created this earthy and grassy gin fizz variation, thanks to matcha. Its name is a nod to Japan’s infatuation with jazz music. The love affair started back in the early twentieth century, when Japanese musicians, who played on ocean liners docked in the US, went offshore and were exposed to the music, which they brought back to Japan. After World War II, jazz musicians were in high demand at US Army base officers’ clubs. From there, jazz went mainstream and was widely embraced.
    ingredients:
    - ¾ ounce Bols genever
    - ¾ ounce Fords gin
    - ½ ounce Lustau Vermut Blanco
    - ¾ ounce Pistachio Orgeat (recipe follows, or use BG Reynolds or Small Hands almond orgeat)
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ¾ ounce egg white
    - 1 barspoon matcha
    - Soda water, chilled
    - "Garnish: 1 matcha-flavored Pocky stick"
    steps:
    - Combine the genever, gin, Lustau, orgeat, lemon juice, egg white, and matcha in a cocktail shaker and dry-shake without ice for 10 seconds. Add 3 ice cubes and shake for 3 seconds. Double-strain into a chilled collins glass over fresh ice. Allow the foam to settle a bit, then top with chilled soda water. Garnish with a matcha-flavored Pocky stick on top.

    author: Julie Reiner
    notes: This cocktail is by Julie Reiner, a leading light of the cocktail renaissance, whose Flatiron Lounge proved that excellent craft cocktails could be made in high volume. She brought craft cocktails to Brooklyn with Clover Club, and her nearby bar, Leyenda, celebrates Latin spirits. Julie grew up on Oahu in Hawaii, and her family had a lychee tree in their front yard. She devoured fresh lychees all the time and wanted to use them in a cocktail. Julie created this libation, as well as a zero-proof version of the drink (without the gin) and named it after her daughter, whose middle name is Leilani, Hawaiian for “heavenly flower.” Her little girl adores the taste of lychees and really enjoys the nonalcoholic version of this drink.
    ingredients:
    - 2 lychee nuts, peeled and pitted
    - 2 ounces Ki No Bi Kyoto dry gin (or substitute Tanqueray, Fords, or Plymouth gin)
    - ½ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ¾ ounce Lemongrass Syrup
    - ½ ounce lychee juice
    - Soda water, chilled
    - "Garnish: lemongrass stalk and lime wheel"
    steps:
    - Muddle the lychee fruit in a cocktail shaker. Add the gin, lime juice, lemongrass syrup, lychee juice, and ice. Shake until chilled, strain into a chilled collins glass over fresh ice, and top with chilled soda water. Garnish with a lemongrass stalk and a lime wheel.

  - name: A Letter From the Shogun
    author: Yasayuki Suzuki
    notes: This recipe is from one of my first bartending mentors, Yasuyuki “Antonio” Suzuki of Tableaux Lounge in Tokyo, under whose tutelage I spent many of my formative years. Antonio’s inspiration harkens back to the historic Battle of Yamazaki, waged in 1582 in present-day Kyoto. The letter in question was from Akechi Mitsuhide, a renegade samurai who had killed his own warlord, Oda Nobunaga, and usurped his power. Compounding this ultimate betrayal, the letter was an appeal to a rival clan to help Mitsuhide consolidate his ill-gotten gains. Forces loyal to the rightful heir, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, intercepted the letter and subsequently defeated the rogue samurai. Hideyoshi went on to become one of Japan’s great unifiers. Antonio’s choice of Yamazaki whisky pays tribute to this battle, with strawberry and pomegranate adding seasonal acidity. It celebrates the triumph of honor and fealty over arrogance and greed.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Strawberry and Pomegranate-Infused Japanese Whisky 
    - ⅓ ounce sake-based yuzu liqueur
    - ¼ ounce fresh lime juice
    - 1 barspoon grenadine
    - "Garnish: Japanese momiji (maple) leaf"
    steps:
    - Combine the whisky, yuzu liqueur, lime juice, and grenadine in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until chilled and strain into a Japanese matcha tea cup over a large piece of hand-carved ice. Garnish with a Japanese momiji (maple) leaf.

  - name: Local Whisky Old-Fashioned
    author: Hasashi Watanabe
    notes: Necessity is the mother of invention, and this cocktail came about as the result of the skyrocketing prices of Japanese whisky in Japan. Hisashi Watanabe, bartender and owner of Bar Gyu+ in Hokkaido, Japan, still wanted to use his country’s renowned whisky in cocktails, but its prospects were looking grim. Undeterred, Hisashi sent his team out to buy up all the affordable whiskies and proceeded to create a house blend of three whiskies from Nikka—Taketsuru Pure Malt, Black Deep Blend, and Black Rich Blend—that wouldn’t break the bank. Taketsuru Pure Malt is a no-age statement blended malt whisky (said to be ten years old) named after Nikka’s founder, and is the company’s respected entry-level pour. The blend contains whiskies from their Miyagikyo and Yoichi distilleries, including sherry cask-finished malts, which impart richness. A simple old-fashioned is the best way to showcase this clever concoction’s multilayered complexity.
    ingredients:
    - 3 brown sugar cubes
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 2 ounces Local Whisky Blend
    - "Garnish: orange twist"
    steps:
    - In an old-fashioned glass, muddle the sugar cubes and bitters. Add the whisky and a large cube of ice and stir until the sugar has dissolved and the drink is chilled. Express an orange twist and place it in the cocktail.

  - name: Odango
    author: Toshihiro Fukami
    notes: Bartender Toshihiro Fukami took inspiration from dango, a traditional Japanese treat made from mochiko (rice flour) that is formed into little spheres, which are then skewered. It is related to mochi, Japanese rice flour sweets. In his home prefecture of Kumamoto, the tasty buns are called ikinari dango and are stuffed with anko (sweetened red bean paste) and sweet potatoes. This drink is a twist on the classic Alexander and swaps in a barrel-aged rice shochu for the traditional brandy, as well as providing a jolt from coffee liqueur.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Hakutake Kin Shiro rice shochu
    - ⅓ ounce Mr. Black coffee liqueur
    - ⅓ ounce anko (sweetened red bean paste)
    - 1 ounce heavy cream
    - ⅓ ounce simple syrup
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    - "Garnish: ground coffee and sweet potato chips"
    steps:
    - Combine the shochu, coffee liqueur, anko, cream, simple syrup, and bitters in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until chilled and strain into a coupe. Garnish with a sprinkling of ground coffee and sweet potato chips.

    author: Lucas Swallows
    notes: This French 75 variation was created by Lucas Swallows, bar director of Momofuku, chef David Chang’s highly influential Asian-inflected restaurant empire that started in the East Village and is now a trendsetting powerhouse. The elegant sipper was designed for Majordomo, the group’s Los Angeles restaurant, and showcases aromatic spirits and modifiers spanning and connecting the Land of the Rising Sun with the Golden State. The cocktail splits the base between the traditional gin, here Japanese, and a citrusy yuzu sake. California sparkling wine and honey bring the West Coast influence.
    ingredients:
    - 3 ounces California brut sparkling wine (bottles by Cruse Wine Co. are worth considering, as are other bottle-conditioned sparklers)
    - ¾ ounce Ki No Bi Kyoto dry gin (or substitute Suntory Roku gin)
    - 1¾ ounces Joto yuzu sake
    - ¼ ounce California acacia honey syrup (3/4 tsp each honey and water)
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    steps:
    - Pour the sparkling wine into a chilled Champagne flute. Combine the gin, sake, honey syrup, and lemon juice in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until chilled and strain into the flute with the sparkling wine.

  - name: Paper Crane
    author: Caer Maiko
    notes: While popular songs and books are common sources of inspiration for cocktail names, this one celebrates origami, the Japanese art of creating intricate sculptures by artfully folding paper. Caer Maiko, bartender at the Roosevelt Room in Austin, Texas, and co-founder of Daijoubu Pop Up, developed this cocktail as an homage to the origami cranes, which almost every Japanese person masters. It is an Asian-accented riff on the Paper Plane, a contemporary classic cocktail that Sam Ross made for the Violet Hour in Chicago, which is itself a twist on the Last Word, a revered classic cocktail. So this is a twist on a twist of a classic drink, which demonstrates how bartenders respect their forerunners, yet feel free to improvise and innovate.
    ingredients:
    - ¾ ounce Suntory Toki whisky
    - ¾ ounce Asian Citrus Blend
    - ½ ounce Amaro Nonino
    - ½ ounce Aperol
    - ½ ounce Tempus Fugit crème de banane
    - 1 dash Burdock Root Tincture 
    - "Garnish: 3 drops sesame oil and an origami paper crane"
    steps:
    - Combine the whisky, citrus blend, Amaro Nonino, Aperol, crème de banana, and tincture in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake and strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with 3 drops of sesame oil on the surface and an origami paper crane clipped to the stem of the glass.

    author: Fuglen Tokyo
    notes: A play on the phrase “Save the World,” this drink was created by Soran Nomura, former bar manager of Fuglen Tokyo and a bartender at Guzzle at the SG Club in Tokyo. It commemorates Jiro Shirasu, a Japanese economist who promoted a close relationship between Japan and the US following World War II, thereby safeguarding peace and, in a way, saving the world from future destruction. Sage and green tea definitely lend a fragrant Japanese note to this Last Word variation, which also includes gin, sherry, and lemon juice.
    ingredients:
    - Absinthe (for spritzing)
    - 2 fresh sage leaves
    - 1 ounce G’Vine Nouaison gin
    - ¾ ounce Manzanilla sherry
    - ⅔ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Sage and Green Tea Syrup
    - "Garnish: fresh sage leaf"
    steps:
    - Spray the inside of a coupe with absinthe. In a cocktail shaker, muddle the sage leaves. Add the gin, sherry, lemon juice, and syrup with ice and shake until chilled. Double-strain into the prepared coupe. Garnish with a fresh sage leaf.

    author: A-K Hada
    notes: "Named after the Fleetwood Mac song, this cocktail by A-K Hada, general manager of Existing Conditions, will set martini fans’ hearts aflutter. The drink’s pearlescent hue, along with its cool, fresh botanicals, are reminiscent of the idyllic land in the drink’s namesake song. A-K splits the base between sake-based umeshu (plum liqueur) and gin, with a touch of aloe liqueur. Her inspiration was culinary: ume shiso maki, a sushi roll stuffed with ume (pickled plum) and shiso that is often served at the end of an omakase meal at her favorite Japanese restaurant."
    ingredients:
    - 1 fresh shiso leaf
    - 1 slice English cucumber
    - 1¾ ounces Kamoizumi umeshu
    - 1¼ ounces Hendrick’s gin
    - 1 teaspoon Chareau aloe liqueur (or substitute green Chartreuse)
    - "Garnish: a cucumber coin pierced by a fresh shiso leaf"
    steps:
    - Muddle the shiso leaf and slice of cucumber in a mixing glass. Add the umeshu, gin, and aloe liqueur with ice and stir. Fine-strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a shiso leaf curled and pulled through the center of a cucumber coin by the stem, rested on the rim of the glass.

  - name: Shunga
    author: Rogerio Igarashi Vaz
    notes: This mischievous pink cocktail is by Rogerio Igarashi Vaz, owner of Bar Trench, a mixology-forward cocktail bar in Tokyo. It is named after shunga, which literally means “spring pictures.” Popular during Japan’s Edo Period, it is the Japanese erotic artform of illustrated ukiyo-e (woodblock) prints, some subtle and suggestive, others unabashedly graphic. This sensuous and refreshing cocktail, powered by barley shochu, is a fitting homage.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Mizunomai barley shochu
    - 1 ounce Cucumber and Basil Shrub
    - 1½ ounces ruby grapefruit juice
    - ½ ounce Fever-Tree tonic water
    - ¼ ounce La Clandestine absinthe
    - "Garnish: cucumber slice and freshly ground black pepper"
    steps:
    - Combine the shochu, shrub, and grapefruit juice in a tumbler with ice. Top with the tonic water and gently stir. Using a barspoon, float the absinthe on top. Garnish with a cucumber slice and freshly ground black pepper.

  - name: Spumoni
    author: Jon Mullen
    notes: This is a twist on an Italian-style cocktail, the Spumoni (Italian for “foam”), that has taken Tokyo by storm. With its origins as a cross between a Greyhound and a Garibaldi, Jon Mullen marries Campari, gin, pink peppercorn syrup, tonic, and “fluffy” grapefruit juice from a Breville juicer, as is done at Dante in Manhattan. The gin he prefers here is Neversink, which has a base of apple distillate rather than grain neutral spirit, which provides a rounder mouthfeel. Mullen had initially learned about the cocktail through the Japanese anime series Bartender, which aired in 2006. It tells the story of a bartending prodigy Ryu Sasakura, his drink-making virtuosity, and his impact on the lives of his guests. While virtually unknown on this side of the Pacific, the Spumoni is worth getting to know and seeing what all the hubbub is all about.
    ingredients:
    - 1¼ ounces Campari
    - ½ ounce Neversink gin
    - ¼ ounce Pink Peppercorn Syrup
    - 1½ ounces Fever-Tree Indian tonic water
    - Fresh grapefruit juice (made fresh with a Breville 800JEXL Juice Fountain Elite, if possible)
    - "Garnish: cracked pink peppercorns"
    steps:
    - Combine the Campari, gin, and syrup in a tumbler over ice and gently stir. Add the tonic water, top with fresh grapefruit juice, and gently stir to combine. Garnish with cracked pink peppercorns.

    author: Yukiko Watanabe
    notes: This cocktail was created by Yukiko Watanabe, former bartender at Sky Lounge Stellar Garden, which is ensconced on the top floor of the Prince Park Tower Tokyo with breathtaking panoramic views of the city. This includes the Tokyo Tower, a symbol of the capital that is recognized around the world. Her drink is a twist on a gin sour, with Japanese gin modified by a unique umeshu (plum liqueur) that has brandy as its base, instead of the more common sake or shochu, with an apple shrub providing balancing acidity. “Stellar” salutes the name of the bar, which itself was named for the shooting stars that are often visible from its thirty-third floor perch, and esperanza (meaning “hope” in Spanish) for the Light of Hope, a blue gemstone that also inspired the cocktail’s color.
    ingredients:
    - Sugar, for rimming the glass
    - Lemon wedge, for rimming the glass
    - 1½ ounces Suntory Roku gin
    - ½ ounce Choya Ume Excellent umeshu (or substitute Choya Umeshu Classic)
    - ⅓ ounce Mizkan Honey Apple Shrub
    - 1 drop natural blue food coloring
    - "Garnish: edible gold leaf"
    steps:
    - Rim a chilled martini glass with sugar. Combine the gin, umeshu, shrub, and food coloring in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until chilled, then strain into the prepared glass. Garnish with edible gold leaf.

    author: Nobuaki Takahashi
    notes: Nobuaki Takahashi, owner and bartender at Recette, a revered Ginza bar, conceived of this time-travel cocktail as something he would serve to John Walker, the historical founder of Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky. The included ingredients would be sure to please Mr. Walker, including Johnnie Walker Gold Reserve, as well as aromatic Earl Grey tea that complements the peaty notes of the whisky. The cocktail is designed to excite all five senses.
    ingredients:
    - 1 whole almond, toasted
    - ½ soft ume (Japanese plum)
    - 1½ ounces Johnnie Walker Gold Reserve
    - 1 teaspoon Housemade Apple Jam
    - ¾ ounce brewed Earl Grey tea, chilled
    - 1 barspoon fresh lime juice
    - 1 teaspoon cane syrup
    - "Garnish: marshmallow and Earl Grey tea smoke"
    steps:
    - In a cocktail shaker, muddle the toasted almond and ume. Add the Johnnie Walker, jam, tea, lime juice, and cane syrup with ice and shake until chilled. Fine-strain into a cocktail glass. Using a small torch, toast a marshmallow and Earl Grey tea leaves to accompany the drink.

    author: Mari Kamata
    notes: This cocktail created by Mari Kamata, beverage manager at the Peninsula Tokyo, has a cinematic inspiration. It takes its name from a 1949 noir film starring Humphrey Bogart, the first Hollywood production filmed in postwar Japan. It tells the tale of Bogart’s hard-boiled character returning to Japan to check on his bar and gambling den, Tokyo Joe. He discovers his Japanese wife has divorced him in absentia, thinking he was a casualty of the war and, simultaneously, finds himself at odds with the Japanese mafia. While good ultimately triumphs, the protagonist’s fate is left ambiguous.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Bombay Sapphire gin
    - ¾ ounce umeshu
    - ⅓ ounce Drambuie
    - 1 ounce cranberry juice
    - ⅓ ounce fresh lemon juice
    steps:
    - Combine the gin, umeshu, Drambuie, cranberry juice, and lemon juice in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until chilled and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

    author: Mina Ebihara
    notes: Mina Ebihara, bartender at Guzzle at The SG Club in Tokyo, created this recipe to incorporate a unique style of enjoying sake, which is sometimes served with a little mound of salt on the rim of the masu. Its base is Tumugi, a koji-spirit introduced by the producer of Iichiko shochu. The cocktail’s name is a play on words on the spirit and the Japanese verb tsumugu, meaning to connect with and be interwoven with people, as this drink certainly encourages.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Tumugi (or substitute Iichiko Saiten shochu)
    - ½ ounce Green Tea-Infused Tumugi 
    - ⅓ ounce Tumugi Syrup 
    - 1 barspoon mirin
    - 1 barspoon yuzu juice
    - 1 fresh shiso leaf, julienned
    - "Garnish: grated yuzu zest and a tiny mound of salt"
    steps:
    - Combine the Tumugi, green tea-infused Tumugi, syrup, mirin, yuzu juice, and shiso leaf in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until chilled and fine-strain into a sake glass set in a masu or in a small stemmed wineglass. Using a Microplane, grate yuzu zest on top of the cocktail and add a tiny mound of salt.

    author: Kodai Yamada
    notes: A cocktail created by Katana Kitten’s exuberantly pompadoured Kodai Yamada, this highball is one of our top sellers at the bar during springtime. Its name means “new, young leaf of the season” in Japanese, and it is his take on the extremely popular Chu-Hai, which is short for Shochu Highball. The drink has a profusion of green notes and herbaceousness, yet it is simple and refreshing. Its base is equal parts iichiko Saiten shochu and French vermouth with a subtle hint of sweet basil. Carbonated tomatillo water adds an herbaceous, fruity body, and highly-carbonated soda water adds the finishing effervescent touch. Kodai garnishes this drink with fresh Thai basil, which has a sharp, peppery aroma.
    ingredients:
    - Wasabi Salt (recipe follows), for rimming the glass
    - Lime wedge for rimming the glass
    - 1 ounce Iichiko Saiten shochu
    - 1 ounce Dolin Blanc vermouth
    - 1 barspoon Clear Creek Douglas fir eau-de-vie
    - 1½ ounces carbonated Tomatillo Water
    - ½ ounce Basil Syrup
    - Soda water, chilled
    - "Garnish: fresh Thai basil leaf"
    steps:
    - Rim half a highball glass with wasabi salt. Add the shochu, vermouth, eau-de-vie, tomatillo water, and basil syrup with ice and gently stir to combine. Top with chilled soda water. Garnish with a fresh Thai basil leaf.

    author: Atsushi Suzuki
    notes: This play on the Bamboo cocktail is courtesy of bartender Atsushi Suzuki, formerly of Savor at the SG Club in Tokyo. The drink itself has its origins in the 1890s, during the first golden age of the cocktail. It was the brainchild of Louis Eppinger, a German-born bartender who held court at the Grand Hotel in Yokohama, one of the first places to serve cocktails in Japan. Atsushi’s version, which he deems a Japanese aperitif cocktail, nods to the classic recipe driven by vermouth and sherry. As a twist, he adds shochu to the mix to provide a more potent base, with rice wine vinegar providing a slight piquant note to this elegant cocktail.
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce The SG Club Kome shochu (or substitute any rice shochu)
    - 1 ounce fino sherry
    - ⅔ ounce sweet vermouth
    - ⅓ ounce dry vermouth
    - 3 dashes rice vinegar
    - "Garnish: yuzu twist"
    steps:
    - Combine the shochu, sherry, vermouths, and vinegar in a mixing glass with ice. Stir until chilled and strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with a yuzu twist.

    author: Hidetsugu Ueno
    notes: The White Lady is the defining cocktail of Hidetsugu Ueno, owner of Bar High Five in Tokyo’s Ginza district and popularizer of the hard shake technique. His recipe adheres very closely to the classic specifications, as is common in cocktail bars in Ginza. If you want to practice the hard shake, this is the drink for it, and you will be rewarded with an exceptional mouthfeel. Mr. Ueno recently revealed to me how the White Lady became his signature cocktail. He had been working at Star Bar, another revered Ginza destination, and a guest asked for a White Lady, a very reasonable request. The problem was, all the bar’s shakers were being used, and the only one left was an oversize shaker designed for cocktail competitions that could make up to five drinks at a time. The guest was very impressed, not only by the cocktail, but by the shaker, and when the guest inquired why Mr. Ueno used such a large shaker, to save face, Ueno told him that only a large shaker could create the tiny bubbles he was seeking. The guest not only believed this white lie, but apparently related it to everyone he knew. Suddenly, guests were coming in and demanding a White Lady made in a “big shaker.” This story has followed Mr. Ueno around the world, and he apologizes for his harmless indiscretion. But it definitely demonstrates the power of storytelling in the cocktail realm.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Tanqueray London dry gin
    - ½ ounce Cointreau
    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    steps:
    - Combine the gin, Cointreau, and lemon juice in a cobbler shaker with ice. Shake until chilled, then strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

    notes: This cocktail by Darryl D. Chan, head bartender at Bar Pleiades in New York City, is inspired by Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, an album (and eponymous song) by the Flaming Lips. A twist on a classic twentieth-century cocktail, the drink’s name refers to the song’s fierce protagonist, Yoshimi, whom Darryl salutes with an equally vibrant measure of shiso and wasabi. He imagines having this drink with Yoshimi after being behind the bar with her and battling off a busy service.
    ingredients:

    author: Julia Momos
    notes: This cocktail was created by Chicago libations luminary Julia Momose of Kumiko, the acclaimed bar and restaurant that has earned a Michelin star. Julia’s drink salutes yuzu, the fragrant Japanese citrus fruit, and chocolate, or choco in Japanese. While it is difficult to classify the cocktail, it will no doubt appeal to martini drinkers and aficionados of all things stirred and spirit-forward. The fact that its foundation is lower-proof shochu preserves the drink’s delicate flavors and enables guests to perhaps indulge in more than one.
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces barley shochu (Yanagita Koma shochu or iichiko Silhouette shochu are recommended, both of which are at the classic 25% ABV)
    - 1 ounce yuzushu (Joto or Umenoyado brands are recommended)
    - ¼ ounce Tempus Fugit crème de cacao
    - 1 teaspoon Suze gentiane liqueur
    - "Garnish: lemon twist and an interwoven lemon twist"
    steps:
    - Combine the shochu, yuzushu, crème de cacao, and Suze with ice in a mixing glass. Stir and strain over cracked or cubed ice in a rocks glass. Express a lemon twist over the cocktail and discard, and garnish with an interwoven lemon twist.
