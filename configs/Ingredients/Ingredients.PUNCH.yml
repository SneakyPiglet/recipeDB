  - name: Cardamom-Coriander Syrup
    ingredients:
      - 2 cinnamon sticks, broken up
      - 1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds
      - 1 tablespoon black cardamom pods
      - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
      - 4 ounces high-proof rum
      - 15 ounces hot water
      - 3/4 cup fine granulated sugar
    steps:
      - Preheat the oven to 450°F. 
      - Spread the cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, and cardamom on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven, tossing occasionally to prevent burning, until fragrant but not burned, about 8 minutes.
      - Combine the toasted spices, red pepper flakes, and rum in a blender, and blend on high speed until evenly ground, about 2 minutes.
      - Meanwhile, in a separate container, combine the hot water and sugar, and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
      - Set aside.
      - Using a coffee filter or multiple layers of cheesecloth, strain the spice and rum mixture into the sugar syrup.
      - Stir to combine.
      - Transfer to a clean, sealable bottle or container.
      - This syrup will keep, refrigerated, for 2 months.
      - Shake thoroughly before using.
      - As a substitute for the cardamom-coriander syrup, Volk recommends using 1/4 ounce St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram and 1 teaspoon of rich simple syrup (2:1, sugar:water).
  - name: Teardrop's DIY Crème de Cacao
    notes: "The crème de cacaos of the mid-19th century were meant to be consumed on their own, and despite their sweetness (their sugary viscosity, not the addition of dairy, is what earned them the “crème” moniker) balance was paramount. But as 20th-century cocktail culture swaggered in, the spotlight shifted to base spirits (whiskey, gin, etc.) and liqueurs went from stand-alone sippers to mere mixers. Thus, producers of liqueurs like crème allowed standards to wane—favoring higher levels sugar over nuance and relying on artificial coloring and oil extracts instead of actual cacao. But now, crème de cacao is seeing revival thanks to bars and bartenders making their own housemade versions that balance nuanced sweetness with the bitter beauty of chocolate. This rum-based recipe comes from Teardrop Lounge in Portland, Oregon."
    ingredients:
      - 1 3/4 cups cacao nibs
      - 1/2 cup sugar
      - 1/2 cup distilled water
      - 1 750-ml bottle Lemon Hart 151 (demerara rum)
    steps:
      - Add sugar and water to a saucepan and set over medium heat.
      - Bring to a low simmer and stir to dissolve sugar.
      - Add cacao nibs, stirring constantly. The sugar will re-granulate and smoke a bit, until it begins to slowly caramelize and coat the cacao nibs. This process should take no more than 15 minutes.
      - Remove from heat, and pour the cacao nibs onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Let cool, then break up with a spoon.
      - Reserve half of the nibs for your next batch, and place the remainder into an airtight container.
      - Top off with the rum.
      - Let steep for one week, then strain through cheesecloth.
      - Measure remaining amount and mix with equal parts distilled water to bring to proof.
      - Funnel into a bottle to serve.

  - name: Moroccan Mint Tea Syrup
    notes: 
    ingredients:
      - Gunpowder green tea
      - Hot water
      - Mint sprigs and leaves
      - Sugar
    steps:
      - Add 24 grams of gunpowder green tea to a pot. Add 227 grams of hot water to the pot and swish. Strain the tea concentrate into a separate container and set aside. Add the strained tea leaves back into the pot and top off with 1 cup of hot water. Swish five times, then strain and discard the water. (The second tea infusion leeches out impurities from the opened tea buds and must be discarded or the syrup will be bitter and unpleasant.)
      - Pour the first tea concentrate back into the pot with the now-cleaned tea leaves and top off with 680 grams of hot water. Set the pot on the burner and bring to a boil on low-medium heat. Once the infusion is boiling, take it off the heat and add in 473 grams of mint sprigs and leaves; a strong mint aroma should start to permeate the air from the tea. Pour about a third of the liquid out of the pot into a separate container then pour back into the pot to fully incorporate the tea and mint flavors. Repeat three times. Do not stir.
      - Once the tea has been aerated, pour it into a container, straining out the tea leaves and mint, lightly pressing the remaining moisture out of them. Weigh the amount of tea made, discounting the container, then add an equal amount by weight of white sugar (roughly 907 grams) and stir until sugar is dissolved. Let the syrup cool and store in the refrigerator. Keeps for 3 weeks.

  - name: Lime-Ginger Cordial
    notes:

      - 36 limes
      - 5 pounds white sugar
      - 2 cups fresh ginger juice (from 1.5-2 pounds ginger)
    steps:
      - Clean and peel 36 limes. Collect peels and the peeled fruit in separate large sealable containers. Cover peels with 5 lbs of white sugar. Shake and mix them until the peels are completely immersed in and mixed with the dry sugar. Leave at room temperature overnight to make oleo saccharum, a slurry of the aromatic citrus oil extracted by the sugar through capillary action.
      - Juice the peeled fruit and add juice to the oleo saccharum, stirring it with elbow grease for 5-10 minutes to break up the lumps and incorporate all. Let rest at room temperature for at least 24 hours to incorporate. Stir again to incorporate any remaining sugar and then strain off the peels through a mesh sieve. At this point you have lime cordial.
      - Next, add about 2 cups of fresh ginger juice to the mix to make lime-ginger cordial. To make fresh ginger juice at home, take 1.5-2 lbs of fresh ginger, peel and chop it into 1" pieces, and put it into a blender in batches, using the cordial to liquefy it. Let it sit with the cordial another 24 hours and then restrain it off into an airtight container and refrigerate until needed.
