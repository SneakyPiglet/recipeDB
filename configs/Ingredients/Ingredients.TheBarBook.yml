- name: Quinine Syrup
  notes: |+2
      Makes 28oz, with enough tincture left over for 2 more batches. You can buy cinchona,whole gentian root, and soft-stick cinnamon in bulk from retailers of herbal medicine andother specialty herb shops. And please use a scale for measurement; it makes a difference.I’m keeping the quantities in metric weights because it’s important to be precise. Anyelectronic scale will have a setting for metrics as well as U.S. weights.
  ingredients: 
  - 6 g powdered cinchona bark (red will be more assertive, yellow is milder and less bitter)
  - 150 ml vodka
  - 20 g citric acid
  - 10 g whole gentian root
  - 2 g Ceylon soft-stick cinnamon, broken by hand into small pieces
  - 30 g lemon peel, peeled with a vegetable peeler
  - 30 g grapefruit peel, peeled with a vegetable peeler
  - 400 g sugar
  - 500 ml water
  steps:
  - "To make the tincture: Dissolve the powdered cinchona bark in the vodka. Mix well, and thenstrain through a paper coffee filter fitted into a strainer (or a filter cone, if you haveone) and suspended over a large enough container to accommodate the final volume of vodka.This process could take up to 1 hour, so don’t worry if it seems like nothing is happening.(The tincture lasts forever.)"
  - "To make the aromatics: Combine all the ingredients for the aromatics in a medium saucepan.Heat over medium heat just until boiling, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes. Strain out the solids and let the liquid cool."
  - Stir 11/2 oz/45 ml of the quinine tincture into the cooled aromatics, and then bottle. Sealtightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks
- name: Ginger Beer
  notes: |+2
      Back in that supermarket mixers section, there are probably a couple of brands of ginger ale, which is more often than not an artificially flavored beverage, sweetened with high fructose corn syrup and best served to children with upset tummies. I even keep a can or two of the stuff in the fridge for when I’m not feeling well. But ginger beer is a completely different animal. The early predecessor to Canadian-born ginger ale, ginger beer first began life in England as a fermented, slightly alcoholic beverage made of fresh ginger, lemon, sugar, water, and a yeast and bacteria compound commonly known as “ginger beer plant.” Ginger beer plant is a live organism composed of Saccharomyces florentinus yeast and Lactobacillus hilgardii bacteria, and is in the same family of bacteria that are used to make kombucha tea, vinegar, and sourdough bread. It would probably be very “authentic nineteenth-century England” to find or culture ginger beer plant and use that for fermentation, but I’ve grown to really like the results I’ve gotten from Champagne yeast. It’s easy and inexpensive. I reach for the Red Star Premier Cuvée brand when I’m at the homebrew shop. Over the years I have developed a series of ginger beer recipes for use at home and in my bars, one of which I published on my website in 2008, and got a great response. But the version we’ve used for the past several years is the one I’ll publish here, a lighter, slightly drier style of the one on my website. I’ve always advocated the use of 16-oz/480-ml flip-top bottles, available at any home-brewing supply store. But these days we bottle in 12-oz/360-ml amber beer bottles, and cap them with a bottle capper, also available at home-brew shops. I find that the rubber gasket that comes with the flip-top bottles tends to wear out, resulting in a flat bottle here or there, so the bottle cap route should be the professional’s choice. Since most bartenders and enthusiasts aren’t going to be making a single bottle at a time, I’m providing a recipe that makes 1 gl/3.8 L of ginger beer. Doing a little math reveals that this will yield eight 16-oz/480-ml bottles, or eleven 12-oz/360-ml bottles. Make sure you’ve got enough of whichever bottle size you choose on hand before starting this project.
  ingredients: 
  - 9 1/4 cups / 22L warm water
  - 10 oz/300 ml ginger juice, juiced from approximately 1 lb/455 g fresh ginger
  - 16 oz/480 ml fresh lemon juice, finely strained
  - 28 oz/840 ml 1:1 simple syrup
  - 1 packet Champagne yeast
  steps:
  - f you don’t really want to measure out the 91/4 cups/2.2 L of warm water you will need, and I know I don’t, you can simply combine the ginger juice, lemon juice, and simple syrup in a 1-gl/3.8-L container and top the whole shebang off with enough warm water to bring the volume to 1 gl/3.8 L. Or you can combine the the ginger juice, lemon juice, and simple syrup in a large container and add exactly 91/4 cups/2.2 L of water. It’s your choice.
  - Next, mix that up very, very well. We definitely don’t want this mixture to be anything but perfectly homogenous. Stir it for a couple of minutes, or if you’re using a 1-gl/3.8-L container with a lid (I find that used water jugs with screw-on lids work well for this project), give it a shake for a minute or two.
  - The next trick is the yeast. You don’t need much to get the job done, so I take a small paring knife, dip the knife point into the yeast packet until I’ve got about 1/2 in/12 mm of yeast covering the tip of that blade (a small paring knife is a perfect tool for this), and then slip the yeast into the neck of each clean, dry bottle.
  - Now, using a funnel, fill each bottle with your ginger beer mixture and cap or seal. I like to make sure everything’s well mixed, so once I’ve got that bottle sealed, I give it a good, hard shake for at least 10 seconds. Find a warm, dark space (under the kitchen sink works well) and let the bottles sit for exactly 48 hours.
  - "During this time your ginger beer is going to undergo a little transformation. The yeast will soon spring to life and begin devouring those sugar molecules, converting them into the three by-products of the fermentation process: a little bit of heat, a trace amount of alcohol, and a whole lot of carbon dioxide gas. After 48 hours you should have enough gas in the bottles to warrant stopping the fermentation process, so your bottles don’t explode."
  - Popping your ginger beer into a cold fridge will stop this process. Once cold, your ginger beer is ready to enjoy. Besure to keep your ginger beer refrigerated at all times; it will last up to 1 week.
  - I might suggest using your Chinese Five-Spiced Dark Rum (page 128) and mixing up a spiced Dark and Stormy (page 68)

  - Seal the bottle and refrigerate; the grenadine will last for up to 1 month.
- name: Raspberry Syrup
  notes: |+2
      In the world of cocktails, there are fewer things more evocative of summer than a syrup made from fresh raspberries. This one adds another layer of farmers' market freshness to your drinks. Makes 2 1/4 cups.
  ingredients: 
  - 2 cups / 335g fresh or good-quality frozen raspberries
  - 8 oz water
  - 1 cup / 250g granulated sugar
  steps:
  - In a medium saucepan, simmer the raspberries in the water until the juice has leached from the fruit and the water and berries are approximately the same color, 5 to 10 minutes.
  - Strain through a strainer, pressing on the berries and then discarding them.
  - Filter the juice through a coffee filter to clarify.
  - While still hot, add the sugar, stirring until dissolved.
  - Let cool, then bottle and refrigerate.
  - The syrup will last about 3 weeks.

- name: Oleo Saccharum
  notes: |+2
      Makes enough for 1 bath of punch.
  ingredients: 
  - One 1-lb box (455g) superfine sugar
  - Zest of 12 lemons (pared with a vegetable peeler)
  steps:
  - Place the sugar and lemon zest into a vacuum seal bag and seal according to the manufacturer's instructions.
  - Let the bag rest at room temperature for at least 4 hours (or up to overnight), until the sugar is soaked in lemon oil. Date the bags and refrigerate. The oleo saccharum will last for 1 month, unopened and stored in the fridge.
  - Alternatively, if you don't have a vacuum sealer, gently muddle the lemon peel with the sugar and let rest for 1 hour. Store in a resealable plastic bag or tight container in the refirgerator for up to 2 weeks.
- name: Strawberry-Mint Shrub
  notes: |+2
      By Neyah White. Makes 48 oz.
  ingredients: 
  - 1 qt / 680g very ripe strawberries, hulled and halved
  - Leaves from 10 sprigs of fresh mint
  - 4 cups / 800g sugar
  - 1 tbsp kosher salt
  - 4 cups cider or white wine vinegar, or a combination of the two
  steps:
  - Put the strawberry halves in the bottom of a large bowl, layer the mint leaves on top, cover with the sugar, and sprinkle with the salt.
  - Let this mixture macerate, covered, at room temerpature for a few hours, stirring occasionally, and then refirgerate for about 8 hours, stirring a few more times to be sure the sugar is making contact with the fruit.
  - After a syrup has formed, add the vinegar and stir to dissolve any remaining sugar.
  - (To speed the process, transfer to a pan and simmer for a few minutes.)
  - Use immediately or let sit for a few days to allow the flavor to deepen.
  - I find my sweet spot if just 1 day.
  - Once you are satisfied with the flavor, filter the mix through a double layer of cheesecloth, pour into clean bottles, and cover tightly.
  - The shrub is essentialy pickled now and can be stored in the refirgerator for up to 4 months.
- name: Thyme-Infused Cointreau
  notes: |+2
      Makes one 750-mL bottle. One little trick that I like to employ behind the bar is infusing flavored liqueurs with complementary flavors. Cointreau is an absolutely gorgeous orange liqueur that just happens to be 80 proof, and if any herb pairs beautifully with orange, it's thyme. One drink that takes advantage of this natural pairing and highlights it beautifully is the White Lady, one of my favorite drinks made with Cointreau.
  ingredients: 
  - 1 cup / 40g fresh thyme sprigs, gently bruised
  - One 750-mL bottle Cointreau
  steps:
  - Combine the thyme and Cointreau in a 1-qt canning jar and let sit for 1 week, agitating regularly.
  - Strain the entire mixture through a strainer lined with a coffee filter set over a bowl.
  - Bottle the infused Cointreau; it should keep indefinitely.
- name: Chinese Five-Spiced Dark Rum
  notes: |+2
      Making your own spiced rum gives you greater control over the flavors in your cocktail than simply purchasing spiced rum off the shelf. For a wintery version of an island cocktail I love so much, I employ Chinese five-spice powder to infuse dark rum - a little trick I picked up while working at Bamboo. Try using 2 oz of your spiced rum in a Dark and Stormy with the house-made Ginger Beer. Makes one 750-mL bottle.
  ingredients: 
  - 1 tsp Chinese five-spice powder
  - One 750-mL bottle dark 80-proof rum, preferably Gosling's Black Seal
  steps:
  - Using a small funnel, spoon the spice powder into the neck of the rum bottle and replace the cap.
  - Shake to mix well.
  - Allow to infuse for 24 hours, agitating regularly.
  - Strain the rum through a coffee filter and rebottle. This will keep forever.
- name: Nocino
  notes: |+2
      "Nocino, like limoncello, is an Italian liqueur and an infusion. It's an infusion of just about everything I've talked about in this chapter: citrus fruit, spices, and nuts - green walnuts. (A fresh walnut straight from the tree looks like a small lime; the best way to find them is to prowl your neighborhood and look in neighbors' yards, but sometimes you can find them at a farmers' market.) You steep the green walnuts, lemons, cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla in Everclear or 100-proof vodka, along with some white wine and sugar. It's tradditional to leave the nocino to steep in the sun in order to speed the process, so a back porch or patio is perfect; shake every few days. You could probably get good results indoors, as well, but it feels more Italian to put the jar outdoors. Nocino is traditionally made on the day of St. John's Feast, June 24, which is when the walnuts should be ripe but still green; the infusions should be ready to strain and filter for Christmas presents. Nocino is quite sweet, but less so than limoncello, and much more complex, with layers of spice, nuts, and a faint bitterness. It's a nice winter sipper and is great with desserts and on ice cream. Makes about 2 quarts." 
  ingredients: 
  - 30 fresh (still soft) green walnuts, quartered (pod and all)
  - One 750-mL 100-proof vodka or grain alcohol, such as Everclear
  - One 750-mL bottle unoaked white wine, such as Pinot Gris or Sauvignon Blanc
  - 2 cups / 400g granulated sugar
  - Zest of 1 lemon
  - 3 cinnamon sticks
  - 20 whole cloves
  - 1 green cardamom pod, crushed
  steps:
  - Combine the walnuts, vodka, white wine, sugar, lemon zest, cinnamon sticks, cloves, and cardamom pod in a 1-gal glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.
  - Let the infusion sit in a window that receives as much direct sunlight as possible for about 5 months, shaking it every day.
  - After 5 months, start tasting.
  - When the flavor is deep and complex, it's time to bottle.
  - Strain the nocino into a large container through a colander first to remove the large ingredients, then strain again through a coffee filter or a super-fine-mesh strainer several times, until most of the sediment is gone.
  - Let the strained nocino sit in a clean bottle for at least a day so that any leftover sediment will settle to the bottom, and then carefully pour it off into your choice of decorate bottles.
  - Nocino keeps for a long time, at least 4 years.
- name: Limoncello
  notes: |+2
      Makes about 2 quarts. In recent years, house-infused liqueurs have become wildly popular, especially those in the 'cello' family. Limoncello - made from lemons - is the most popular, but other citrus cellos (pronounced like the musical instrument), such as tangerine and blood orange, are showing up on bar menus and as holiday gifts from crafty friends. The process consists of infusing grain alcohol or high-proof vodka with citrus zest for 3 months, and then mixing with simple syrup for sweetness. The Italians serve limoncello as a digestif, traditionally in a small chilled ceramic cup, but it shows up in cocktails and even desserts. Cellos are often oversweetened; I prefer to use them in moderation.
  ingredients: 
  - 15 lemons
  - Two 750-mL bottles 100-proof vodka
  - 4 cups / 800g sugar
  - 5 cups / 1.2L water
  steps:
  - Wash the lemons well under running hot water and pat dry. Peel the zest from the lemons in long, wide strips.
  - Combine the lemon peel snad 1 bottle of vodka in a 1-gal glass jar with a lid.
  - Cover the jar and store it at room temperature, away from light, for about 6 weeks.
  - Give the jar a swirl every few days.
  - After the 6 weeks, make a sugar syrup.
  - Combine the sugar and water in a medium saucepan.
  - Bring to a boil and let the syrup continue boiling for 5 minutes.
  - Let cool, then add it to the limoncello mixture, along with the second bottle of vodka.
  - Cover the jar and infuse for another 5 to 6 weeks, swirling the jar a few times during this period.
  - Strain the limoncello through a fine-mesh strainer into clean, decorative bottles; discard the lemon zest.
  - Limoncello tastes best when very cold, so store your bottle in the freezer.
  - It should be good for at least a year.
- name: Cinnamon Tincture
  notes: |+2
      Makes about 6 ounces.
  ingredients: 
  - About 2 sticks Ceylon soft-stick cinnamon
  - 1 cup 100-proof vodka
  steps:
  - Grind the cinnamon in a spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle.
  - In a small canning jar, combine the vodka and cinnamon.
  - Cover and shake to combine.
  - Let sit for 1 week, shaking occasionally to agitate.
  - Strain through a coffee filter and store in a labeled dropper bottle.
  - This keeps forever.
- name: House Orange Bitters
  notes: |+2
      Makes one 750-mL bottle.
  ingredients: 
  - One 750-mL bottle overproof white rum, preferably Wray and Newphew
  - 3 oz dried grated orange peel
  - 2 whole cardamom pods, crushed
  - 1/2 tsp caraway seeds, crushed
  - 1 1/2 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
  - 1 3/4 oz 2:1 Demerara Syrup
  steps:
  - Combine the rum, orange peel, cardamom pods, caraway seeds, and coriander seeds in a clean canning jar.
  - Leave for 1 week, away from direct sunlight, gently agitating about once a day.
  - Add the Demerara syrup and let sit for 1 week more, again agitating daily.
  - Strain the mixture through a coffee filter and store in clean, labeled dropper bottles.
  - The bitters will keep indefinitely.
- name: Daniel Shoemaker's Brandied Cherries
  notes: |+2
      
    Those who are obsessed with controlling every step of cocktail making often want to make everything possible from scratch. And there is nobody I know in this business who is more obsessed than my friend Daniel Shoemaker, owner of the Teardrop Lounge here in Portland, Oregon. Daniel is a lucky man, because he found a healthy outlet for his obsessive-compulsive nature: he opened a bar at which just about everything is house made, which means we're lucky, too. At Teardrop Lounge, you can get house-pickled onions, house-tinctured roots and barks, house-made Amer Picon, house-carbonated tonic water, house-macerated mango-chipotle hot sauce, and just about anything else you can think of. Among the best of these craft cocktail components are the brandied cherries, for which Daniel generously shares his recipe here.

    Oregon is big cherry country, and Daniel gets late-harvest fruit from the Hood River Valley, just east of Portland. The cherries tend to be big, firm, and full of sugar, which is perfect for these garnishes. He usually uses the Lapin variety, which is dark magenta, but you should choose whatever variety looks best in your region. This recipe is for sweet cherries, however, not tart pie cherries, like the Montmorency. It makes a lot, but brandied cherries make great gifts, so you won't regret the abundance.
  ingredients: 
  - 5 lb / 2.25 kg ripe, firm sweet cherries
  - 1/2 cup whole juniper berries
  - 1/2 cup whole allspice berries
  - 6 cinnamon sticks, lightly crushed
  - 3 whole star anise
  - 5 cups sugar
  - 8 oz fresh lemon juice, strained
  - 3 cups water
  - 20 oz brandy
  - 12 oz white rum
  - 8 oz bourbon
  steps:
  - Clear away anything that you don't want to get spattered with cherry juice. It sprays and it stains, even when you're careful, so wear an old T-shirt. Pull off the stems and punch out the pits of the cherries with a cherry pitter. (A trick that some cooks use is to put their hands and the pitter inside a very large plastic bag as they pit. The bag will corral much of the juice.)
  - Heat the oven to 200°F/95°C. Place five 1-qt/960-ml canning jars right-side up on a baking sheet and put in the oven for 20 minutes; you can turn off the heat and leave them in the oven until ready to use. In a saucepan, simmer the lids in water to cover for 2 minutes and lay them out on paper towels to drain.
  - Dump the juniper berries, allspice berries, cinnamon sticks, and star anise in the center of a double layer of cheesecloth and tie into a secure bundle. Fill a large stockpot or canning kettle about one-third full of water and bring to a boil. This will be your water bath for canning the cherries.
  - Meanwhile, combine the sugar, lemon juice, and the 3 cups/720 ml water in another large stockpot, at least 10 qt/9.5 L. Bring to a simmer, stirring just until the sugar is dissolved. Add the spice bundle, and continue to simmer for about 5 minutes. Add the cherries, stopping when the pot is about half full; you'll be adding another 5 cups/1.2 L of liquid and you'll need to be able to stir the cherries without them spilling out. (You'll probably need to cook the cherries in two or three batches.)
  - Using the slotted spoon, stir and fold the cherries onto themselves so that they are all soaked in the syrup and are getting thoroughly warmed. You don't want to actually cook the cherries, just let them absorb the syrup. Return the liquid to a simmer; pour in the brandy, rum, and bourbon; and stir to mix. When the liquid is heated through, take the pot off the heat. (Be sure not to boil the liquid because you don't want to cook off too much alcohol.)
  - Using a wide-mouth funnel or jar filler and a slotted spoon, pack each canning jar with cherries, filling it to the top. Give the jar a good tap on the counter to settle the fruit so there are minimal air gaps. Ladle the hot syrup into the jars up to about 1/2 in/12 mm from the rim. Place the flat part of the lid on the jar, and screw the band on lightly.
  - Add the next batch of cherries to the hot syrup remaining in the pot and heat the cherries through. Transfer to jars, top with syrup, and seal the jars.
  - When all the jars are filled and the lids are on, put the jars into the boiling water bath in batches, as many as will fit without crowding. The water should cover the jars by about 1 in/2.5 cm, so top off with more boiling water if necessary. Boil for 5 minutes, and then retrieve the jars (Daniel uses silicone oven mitts to lift and transfer the jars). Set them on the counter to cool and let the seals form properly. You'll hear a nice pop as the vacuum forms and the lid is sucked down. Tighten the rings of all the jars that have sealed properly. You can store these at room temperature, away from heat and light, for up to 1 year. If you have any jars that didn't seal properly, simply keep them in the refrigerator and use within 2 weeks.
- name: Todd Thrasher's Pickled Onion
  notes: |+2
      
    Truth be told, I was never a fan of cocktail onions until I tried the onions my friend Todd Thrasher made himself at his bar PX in Alexandria, Virginia. They're a far cry from the foul-smelling specimens avilable at your local liqour store.
  ingredients: 
  - 1 tbsp pickling spice
  - 24 oz warm filtered water
  - 32 oz distilled Champagne vinegar
  - 2 cups sugar
  - 1 lab pearl onions, peeled
  steps:
  - Tie the pickling spice in a sachet of cheesecloth. Combine the warm water, vinegar, sugar, and salt in a large nonreactive pot over medium heat; stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. Put the pickling spice in the vinegar solution. Add the onions, making sure they are completely covered with liquid. Bring to a boil and continue boiling for only 1 minute (it's important to limit the boil; otherwise the onions will lose their crunchy texture).
  - Remove from the heat, and transfer the onions and liquid to a clean 1-pt/480-ml glass jar and let cool overnight, covered, at room temperature. The onions will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.
