    - Combine 1 part wildflower honey to 4 parts heavy whipping cream. Whip lightly, until the mixture thickens but still has enough viscosity to pour smoothly. Use immediately.

#TSC (Tomato Sherry Cobbler)
  - name: Tomato Water Syrup
    notes: Makes about 12 ounces.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 pound vine-ripened tomatoes
    steps:
    - Stem, core, and coarsely chop the tomatoes. Place in a blender and blend on high until smooth. Line a sieve with a dampened kitchen towel or thick paper towels and set over a bowl. Pour the tomato puree into the lined sieve and let sit. It will take about 1 hour to yield about 10 ounces of tomato water. Weigh the tomato water and mix it with half of its weight of granulated sugar and a pinch of salt, to taste. Mix until fully homogenized. Store refrigerated for up to 1 week, or portion into ice cube trays and store in your freezer until it is time for a cocktail.

#Bell Pepper Margarita
  - name: Bell Pepper Syrup
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 1 green bell pepper
    - Granulated sugar
    steps:
    - Remove the stem, membrane, and seeds from a green bell pepper and discard. Chop the remaining green parts into smaller pieces. Put through a juicer or blend in a high-powered blender and strain into a bowl. Weigh the juice and add an equal weight of granulated sugar. Whisk in a bowl or transfer to a shaker tin and shake until the sugar is fully dissolved. Store refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.

#Opal Martini
  - name: Lemongrass-Infused Shōchū
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 2 stalks of fresh lemongrass
    - 1 (750 mL) bottle of rice or barley shōchū, ideally Chiyonosono 8,000 Generations rice shōchū, Takahashi Shuzō’s Hakutake Shiro rice shōchū, or Takahashi Shuzō’s Ginrei Shiro rice shōchū
    steps:
    - Peel the outer leaves and trim the tips and tails of 2 stalks of fresh lemongrass. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Take the tip of a knife and slice through the lower stalk of the lemongrass, rotating to make three incisions while keeping the stalk intact. This will make for a better infusion and allow you to remove the lemongrass more easily when it is ready. Place the prepared lemongrass into a 750-milliliter bottle of rice or barley shōchū at room temperature and infuse for 3 days. I suggest Chiyonosono 8,000 Generations rice shōchū, Takahashi Shuzō’s Hakutake Shiro rice shōchū, or their Ginrei Shiro rice shōchū for this infusion. The infusion will last indefinitely.

#Chawari Toddy
  - name: 
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 2 teaspoons bancha
    - 6½ ounces water just off the boil (around 195°F)
    steps:
    - In a glass or ceramic brewing vessel, combine 2 teaspoons bancha and 6½ ounces water just off the boil (around 195°F) and steep for 2 to 3 minutes. Bancha may be resteeped up to three times. As you resteep, you may need to raise the temperature of the water incrementally.

#Spiced Chrysanthemum Latte
  - name: Chrysanthemum Tisane
    notes: Makes about 7 ounces.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 to 1½ teaspoons chrysanthemum herbal tea
    - 8 ounces just-boiled water
    steps:
    - In a glass or ceramic brewing vessel, measure 1 to 1½ teaspoons chrysanthemum herbal tea. Pour 8 ounces just-boiled water over the flowers and steep for 5 to 10 minutes. The flowers may be resteeped over and over again. For the latte recipe, I suggest using first-steep tea as the flavor is more pronounced.
  - name: Spiced Kuromitsu
    notes: Makes 10 ounces.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 tablespoons cracked star anise pods
    - 1 teaspoon dried sanshō berries
    - 2 teaspoons coriander seeds
    - 1 cup water
    - ¾ cup shaved kokutō
    - 5 tablespoons honey
    steps:
    - With a mortar and pestle, crack enough star anise pods to yield 2 tablespoons, and combine with 1 teaspoon dried sanshō berries and 2 teaspoons coriander seeds. In a dry saucepan, toast the cracked spices over medium-low heat until aromatic. Add 1 cup room-temperature water, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and simmer for 3 minutes. Strain the spiced water over ¾ cup of shaved kokutō in a tempered bowl. Stir until the kokutō dissolves into a homogenous mixture; I recommend doing this over a double boiler as the kokutō can be difficult to dissolve (hence the tempered bowl). Measure in 5 tablespoons honey. Stir until fully incorporated and chill. Store refrigerated for up to 3 weeks.

#Yaki-imo Old Fashioned
  - name: Salt-Roasted Sweet Potato-Infused Japanese Whisky
    notes: Makes about 20 ounces.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 to 3 medium sweet potatoes
    - Coarse kosher salt
    - 1 (750mL) bottle Japanese whisky with an ABV of 45% or higher, such as Ichiro's Malt and Grain, Nikka From The Barrel or Hibiki Japanese Harmony
    steps:
    - Preheat the oven to 425°F. Wash 2 to 3 medium sweet potatoes and prick a few holes into the skin using a fork. Line a medium baking sheet with foil and cast a thick layer of coarse kosher salt over the foil. Then place the prepared sweet potatoes on the bed of salt and cover with another layer of salt. Wrap the edges of the foil up over the sweet potatoes and cover with another sheet of foil and bake for 1 hour. Remove the top piece of foil and continue to bake for another 15 minutes. Once cool enough to handle, brush the salt from the skin of the sweet potatoes. Peel the sweet potatoes and break them apart into smaller pieces. Place 1½ cups of the roasted sweet potatoes into a large container with a lid and add a 750-milliliter bottle of Japanese whisky (something with an ABV of 45% or higher, such as Ichiro's Malt and Grain, Nikka From The Barrel or Hibiki Japanese Harmony). Set aside to infuse for 2 days, shaking well two or three times a day to break apart the sweet potato. Strain through a coffee filter or cheesecloth and store in an airtight container or sterilized bottle in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

  - name: Amazaké
    notes: "Originally invented as a medicinal elixir in the Kofun period (approximately 300–538 AD), amazaké is a traditional Japanese drink made from the same ingredients as Japanese saké: fermented rice, water, and kōji. Despite its name (zaké is a word for “alcohol”), the beverage is usually alcohol-free or very low-proof. With a restorative nature, amazaké may be enjoyed cold or hot. In the summertime, I enjoy it blended with banana and served cold, or laced with shiozakura for a pleasantly salty refresher. When hot, it is execeptional with green tea—or served with grated ginger, as is customary when people visit temples in the first week of the new year. To make amazaké, rinse 1 cup of short-grain Japanese rice once to remove any debris. Drain and rinse again, this time raking your fingers through the rice, allowing the grains to gently polish themselves. Continue to rinse and flush until the water runs clear. Add the rice to a rice cooker. Fill with water to the 3 cup line. Cook the rice according to the rice cooker instructions, taking care that the water does not boil over. If your rice cooker has a porridge setting, use that, but with water that comes to the 1 cup line rather than the 3 cup measuring line. When the rice is cooked, remove the bowl from the rice cooker and use a rice paddle or spoon to make slices through the rice. This allows air flow, turning the rice over so that it releases its heat. To speed up the process, try using a fan to cool. In 10 to 20 minutes, the rice should reach the optimal temperature. Gradually add 1 cup of water to the rice. Stir to even out and let sit until the temperature comes down to 130°F. This takes about 10 minutes. Once it comes to temperature, crumble in one 200-gram packet of komékōji. It helps to crumble the kōji while it is still in the bag, pressing with your fingers until the pieces are loose. Mix the kōji into the steamed rice, and return the rice bowl to the rice cooker and cover loosely with a clean towel. Set the rice cooker to warm and leave the lid open so that the temperature remains between 130°F and 140°F for 8 hours. Stir occasionally to keep the heat evenly distributed. The amazaké will start to smell sweet with a hint of tang. After 8 hours, remove the bowl from the rice cooker and chill in an ice bath. Blend the rice in a high-powered blender until smooth. Store in the refrigerator."
    ingredients: 
    - 1 cup short-grrain Japanese rice
    - 1 cup water
    - 1 200-gram packet komékōji

#Million Dollar
  - name: Grenadine
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 2 parts pomegranate molasses
    - 1 part pomegranate juice
    - 1 part cane sugar
    steps:
    - Before going out to buy the bright red grenadine of childhood Shirley Temples, consider purchasing BG Reynolds or Small Hand Foods grenadine. Both of those are delicious and reliable products that will bring consistency and richness to a cocktail. If you prefer to make your own batch at home, in a saucepan, combine the listed ingredients. Warm over low heat and whisk just until the sugar is completely dissolved. If it starts to bubble, remove from the heat and continue to whisk. Store refrigerated for up to 3 weeks.

  - name: Cashew Orgeat
    notes: Makes 32 portions.
    ingredients: 
    - 5 green cardamom pods
    - 16 fluid ounces cashew milk
    - sugar
    - ¼ teaspoon orange blossom water
    steps:
    - "Crack 5 green cardamom pods and toast in a pan over low heat until aromatic (make sure you agitate the pan so they don’t burn). To make via sous vide: Pour 16 fluid ounces cashew milk (such as Elmhurst) in a sous vide bag with the toasted cardamom. Seal the bag and cook sous vide for 1 hour at 180°F."
    - "To make on the stovetop: Combine 16 fluid ounces cashew milk with the cardamom pods in a saucepan and gently warm the mixture. Keep covered on low (just under a simmer) for 30 minutes, and adjusting the heat as necessary to make sure it does not boil over or burn."
    - Strain the cardamom out of the milk. Weigh the milk and add 2 parts sugar to 1 part spiced cashew milk by weight. Finish with ¼ teaspoon of orange blossom water. Store in the refrigerator.
  - name: Shiso No Jyūsu
    notes: Makes 30 portions.
    ingredients: 
    - 12 ounces red shiso leaves
    - 7½ cups (60 fluid ounces) water
    - 1¾ cups sugar
    - 2 teaspoons citric acid (or a scant ½ cup apple cider vinegar)
    steps:
    - Wash 12 ounces of red shiso leaves and set aside. In a large pot, bring 7½ cups (60 fluid ounces) water to a rolling boil. Add the shiso and boil for 5 minutes and then remove from the heat. Scoop out and discard the shiso leaves, leaving the water in the pot. Add 1¾ cups sugar to the shiso water and stir to dissolve. Add 2 teaspoons citric acid (or a scant ½ cup apple cider vinegar) to the pot and stir until the juice turns magenta. After the juice has cooled, carefully decant into a glass storage container. Keep refrigerated.
  - name: Shiozakura Saline Solution
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 20 shiozakura flowers
    - warm water
    steps:
    - Remove the shiozakura (salted sakura blossoms) from the packet. For enough garnish for 10 cocktails, I recommend working with at least 20 flowers. Some will fall apart, so it is best to have plenty. (Or alternatively, if you only plan to use a few at a time, only rinse what you will need, as the salt acts as preservative.) Place a bowl on a scale and tare the weight. Add the shiozakura and make a note of the weight, then add two times their weight of warm water and stir until the salt dissolves. Set a sieve over a bowl and separate the flowers from the liquid. Store the saline solution in a sealed container and store the flowers in fresh water in the refrigerator.
  - name: Umé-Su
    notes: Makes 2 quarts.
    ingredients: 
    - 2.2 pounds umé
    - 2.2 pounds rock sugar
    - 1 cup rice vinegar
    steps:
    - There are several reliable brands of umé-su you can buy on the commercial market, but please note that there are two distinct types. Uméboshi-su, made from salt-pickled umé and shiso, is extremely salty and sour. Umé-su is sour and sweet. I have had the most luck in the US finding umé-su in Japanese and Korean markets. Look for sugar, not salt, as a key ingredient. It is more common to see the term “extract” used on the Korean-made products. They will have varying levels of sweetness to acidity. To adjust the acidity, I sometimes add rice vinegar. My current easily accessible umé drinking vinegar of choice is Beksul Plum Extract, available from Amazon and H Mart.
    - "If you want to make your own version at home, here is my recipe: Wash 2.2 pounds umé and remove the small round caps at the stem end. Pierce each one 5 or 6 times evenly across the surface with a toothpick. Lay the umé out on a clean towel and pat dry. Once dry, put the umé in a plastic bag and freeze until hard. Sterilize a large lidded jar (with a 5-quart capacity) with boiling water, and set aside 2.2 pounds white rock sugar. Once the jar is ready, place layers of the rock sugar and umé in the jar, beginning and ending with rock sugar. Pour 1 cup rice vinegar over the contents of the jar. Put the lid on rather lightly for the first week to allow the pressure to escape. Swirl the jar once a day for about a week. The syrup will be ready in 2 to 3 weeks. When ready to use, remove the umé and store in a separate jar for snacking or garnish. Store the finished syrup in sterilized jars in the fridge."
  - name: Umé-Shu
    notes: Makes 45 ounces.
    ingredients: 
    - 2.2 pounds umé
    - 2.2 pounds rock sugar
    - 6¼ cups (50 fluid ounces) shōchū or vodka (35% to 40% ABV)
    steps:
    - "There are several commercial brands of umé-shu, but if you want to make your own version at home, here is my recipe: Wash 2.2 pounds umé and remove the small round caps at the stem end. Pierce each one 5 or 6 times with a toothpick. Lay the umé out on a clean towel and pat dry. Once dry, put the umé in a plastic bag and freeze until hard. Sterilize a large lidded jar (with a 5-quart capacity) with boiling water, and set aside 2.2 pounds rock sugar. Once the jar is ready, place layers of the rock sugar and umé in the jar, beginning and ending with rock sugar. Pour 6¼ cups (50 fluid ounces) shōchū or vodka (35% to 40% ABV) over the contents of the jar. Seal the container with the lid. Store in a cool, dry place and rotate every week or so. It will take at least 6 months before the umé-shu is ready to drink, though I wait at least 1 year to let the flavors develop."
  - name: Rich Honey Syrup
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 2 parts honey
    - 1 part hot water
    steps:
    - Combine 2 parts honey to 1 part hot water by weight. Stir until the honey has fully dissolved. Store refrigerated for up to 3 weeks.
  - name: Kinmokusei Syrup
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 1 tablespoon dried kinmokusei (osmanthus) flowers
    - 1 cup water heated to 205°F (or just boiled)
    steps:
    - Combine 1 tablespoon dried kinmokusei (osmanthus) flowers with 1 cup water heated to 205°F (or just boiled) and steep for 6 minutes. Strain. Weigh the liquid and add an equal amount of sugar by weight. Store refrigerated for up to 1 week.
  - name: Lime Cordial
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 2 limes
    - 1 cup sugar
    - 1 ounce lime juice
    steps:
    - Using a Y-peeler, strip off the zest of 2 limes, avoiding the pith as much as possible. Set the peeled limes aside for use later. In a bowl, combine the peels and 1 cup sugar and mix thoroughly and vigorously, muddling the peels to express the oils from the zest into the sugar granules. Rest for at least 15 minutes. Transfer to a saucepan. Juice 1 ounce of lime juice and add to the pan, bringing the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring consistently until the sugar dissolves. Let the lime peels sit in the hot mixture for 10 minutes, then strain and let cool.
    - Store in the refrigerator. Best if used within 3 days.
  - name: Rich Cane Syrup
    notes: Petite Canne sugarcane syrup from Martinique is a great commercial cane syrup to use in cocktails; it is consistent in sweetness and offers a rounder texture than homemade versions. But if you want to make this from scratch, combine 2 parts cane sugar to 1 part hot water by weight. Stir until the cane sugar has fully dissolved. Store refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 parts cane sugar
    - 1 part hot water
    steps:
    - 
  - name: Rich Demerara Syrup
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 2 parts demerara sugar
    - 1 part hot water

    - Combine 2 parts demerara sugar to 1 part hot water by weight. Stir until the sugar has fully dissolved. Store refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.
  - name: Simple Syrup
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 1 part granulated sugar
    - 1 part warm water
    steps:
    - Combine 1 part granulated sugar to 1 part warm water by weight. Stir until the sugar has fully dissolved. Store refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.
  - name: Strawberry Syrup
    notes: Makes about 20 ounces.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 pound strawberries
    - Granulated sugar
    steps:
    - "Hull 1 pound strawberries: To hull a strawberry, place the tip of the knife just under the green leafy cap and cut a small cone out of the top of the strawberry, removing the hard white core underneath. Rinse the strawberries and pat them dry. Halve lengthwise. Place a bowl on a scale and weigh the strawberries. Add an equal weight of granulated sugar to the bowl. Stir well until each strawberry half is coated in sugar. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for 24 hours. At this point the juices of the strawberries will have leached out into the sugar. Weigh the batch, transfer strawberries and juice into a pot, and add half of the weight in water. Bring up to a simmer over medium-low heat, allowing it to bubble away for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow it to cool. Strain out strawberries (and discard, or save for other uses) and store refrigerated for up to 2 weeks."
  - name: Ginger-Infused Shōchū
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
    - 1 (750mL) bottle rice shōchū
    steps:
    - In a large glass jar, combine 3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger and one 750-milliliter bottle rice shōchū and let infuse at room temperature for 24 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve (or for a smoother finish through a coffee filter). I suggest Chiyonosono 8,000 Generations rice shōchū or Takahashi Shuzō’s Hakutake Shiro rice shōchū for this infusion. The infusion will last indefinitely.
  - name: Green Tea-Infused Shōchū
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 5 tablespoons loose-leaf Japanese green tea
    - 1 (750mL) bottle rice or barley shōchū
    steps:
    - In a large glass jar, combine 5 tablespoons loose-leaf Japanese green tea and one 750-milliliter bottle rice or barley shōchū and let infuse at room temperature for 3 hours. Strain and store in a cool, dark place. I suggest Chiyonosono 8,000 Generations rice shōchū, Takahashi Shuzō’s Ginrei Shiro rice shōchū, or The Yanagita Koma Honkaku barley shōchū for this infusion. The infusion will last indefinitely.
  - name: Spice-Infused Vodka
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 1 tablespoon pink peppercorns
    - 1 tablespoon dried hibiscus
    - ¼ teaspoon salt
    - 1 tablespoon fresh wasabi
    - 1 (750 mL) bottle Suntory Haku vodka
    steps:
    - In a suribachi (mortar and pestle), lightly crack 1 tablespoon pink peppercorns. Add the cracked pink peppercorns, 1 tablespoon dried hibiscus, ¼ teaspoon salt, and 1 tablespoon grated fresh wasabi* to a large glass jar. Pour in a 750-milliliter bottle of Suntory Haku vodka. Allow to infuse at room temperature for 48 hours. Strain through a coffee filter and store refrigerated for up to 3 weeks. 
    - If you do not have fresh wasabi, you can use wasabi paste—just be sure to seek a brand that uses actual wasabi and not horseradish. The label will say “hon-wasabi.”	
  - name: Chilled Hōjicha
    notes: Makes about 9 ounces.
    ingredients: 
    - 3 grams hōjicha
    - 10 ounces hot water
    steps:
    - In a glass or ceramic brewing vessel, combine 3 grams hōjicha and 10 ounces hot water (195°F) and steep for 2 minutes. Strain into a glass vessel and place in the refrigerator to cool. For a faster chill, you can set up an ice bath and cool it, uncovered, on the countertop or in the sink.
  - name: Chilled Mugi-Cha
    notes: Makes about 30 ounces.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 quart water
    - 1 sachet mugi-cha
    steps:
    - In a saucepan, bring 1 quart water to a boil. Add 1 sachet mugi-cha to the water, lower the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to steep for 10 minutes. Strain off the brewed mugi-cha and cool in an ice bath. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
  - name: Cold-Brew Sencha
    notes: Makes about 24 ounces.

    - 3 cups room temperature filtered water
    steps:
    - In a glass jar, combine 10 tablespoons sencha leaves and 3 cups room temperature filtered water and steep for 3 hours. Strain out the leaves and keep the tea. I enjoy steeping the leftover leaves for a personal cup or two of tea after cold-brewing. There is still flavor in the leaves and I hate to waste such goodness.
