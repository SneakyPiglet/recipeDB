#Syrups & Cordials
  - name: Basil Stem Syrup
    ingredients: 
    - 500 grams water
    - 50 grams basil stems 
    - 500 grams unbleached cane sugar
    steps:
    - In a saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Remove from the heat, add the basil stems, and let steep for 30 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh sieve lined with several layers of cheesecloth, then add the sugar and whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Transfer to a storage container and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 2 weeks.
  - name: Grilled Pineapple Syrup
    ingredients: 
    - 1 pineapple
    - 500 grams unbleached cane sugar 
    - 2.5 grams citric acid powder
    steps:
    - Peel and cut the pineapple into 34-inch-thick wheels, then grill over a wood fire until slightly smoky but not burned. Let cool, then run it through a juice extractor. Weigh out 500 grams of the juice, reserving the rest for another use. Combine the juice, sugar, and citric acid in a blender and process until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve lined with several layers of cheesecloth, then transfer to a storage container and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 4 weeks.
  - name: House Lemon Cordial
    ingredients: 
    - About 3 quarts lemon wheels or wedges, or the rinds of 10 lemons 
    - 600 grams white sugar 
    - 1,400 grams fresh lemon juice
    -  Pectinex Ultra SP-L
    steps:
    - Combine the lemon wheels or wedges and sugar in a large container. Cover and refrigerate for 2 days. Occasionally stir the mixture (the citrus oils will be extracted into the sugar and the mixture will liquefy).
    - Strain, then measure the weight of the liquid (discard the solids). Combine with the lemon juice, and stir until dissolved. Calculate 0.2% of the weight (multiply by 0.002) to get X grams. Stir in X grams of Pectinex, then cover and let sit for 15 minutes.
    - Divide the mixture evenly among your centrifuge containers. Weigh the filled containers and adjust the amount of liquid in each as needed to ensure their weights are exactly the same; this is important for keeping the machine in balance. Run the centrifuge at 4,500 rpm for 12 minutes.
    - Remove the containers and carefully strain the cordial through a paper coffee filter or Superbag, being careful not to disturb the solids that have collected on the bottom of the containers. If any particles remain in the cordial, strain it again. Transfer to a storage container and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 1 month.

Let stand for 15 minutes, shaking the canister every 30 seconds or so, then release the pressure. Point the canister's nozzle at a 45-degree angle into a container. Vent the gas as quickly as possible without spraying liquid everywhere; the quicker the venting, the better the infusion. When all of the gas is out, open the canister and take a listen. Once there is no longer audible bubbling, strain the infusion through a paper coffee filter or Superbag. Funnel back into the vodka bottle and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 4 weeks.
