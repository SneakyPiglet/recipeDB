  - name: Orgeat
    notes: Orgeat is an almond-based syrup that has been part of cocktail culture since the mid-nineteenth century. It's a key ingredient in the vintage Japanese Cocktail (brandy, orgeat, and Angostura bitters) and especially the mai tai and its tiki brethren. Made primarily from water and almonds, along with other ingredients such as orange flower water and cognac, it has a unique flavor that's more than the sum of its ingredients and something altogether individual. It's milky and nutty but not cloying. It deepens the flavors of other ingredients and bridges magically between refreshing and savory, creating an ethereal mouthfeel that makes ingredients meld in unexpected ways, and at Death & Co, we use it in many styles of cocktails.
    ingredients:
    - 12 ounces toasted almond milk
    - 16 ounces superfine sugar
    - 2½ teaspoons Pierre Ferrand Ambre cognac
    - 2½ teaspoons Lazzaroni amaretto
    - ¼ teaspoon rose water
    steps: 
    - To make the toasted almond milk, toast 1 cup blanched sliced almonds in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Transfer to a blender and add 2 cups and 2 tablespoons warm water. Pulse until the almonds are finely chopped, then blend for 2 minutes. Strain through a cheesecloth-lined sieve.
    - In a saucepan, combine the almond milk and sugar. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally and without bringing to a boil, until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the cognac, amaretto, and rose water. Store in the refrigerator for up to one month.

Don't be alarmed by the smell or the sludge on top. After 1 week, stir in ½ cup of raw sugar and boil gently for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. (The smell will be a bit offensive, so open the  doors and windows.) Cool slightly, then strain through a cheesecloth-lined fine- mesh sieve. Make a test shrub: Cool 3 to 4 tablespoons of the cherry mixture. (Cover the pot to keep its contents warm.) Fill a 20-ounce glass with ice. Add  water or club soda to almost the rim, then stir in the chilled cherry mixture. Taste and adjust as needed. If it's too tart, add another ½ cup or so of sugar, little by little, while it's still hot, stirring after each addition, until the sugar is dissolved. Once the taste is to your liking, cool completely. Store in the refrigerator, where it will keep indefinitely."
