  - name: Simple Syrup
    notes: |+2
      "Simple syrup is the most basic sweetener used in cocktails, and as the name states, it's simple–made of just sugar and water. Like salt, sugar is a flavor enhancer, and simple syrup is used to bring out the character of other cocktail ingredients. Its sweetness also balances acidic elements like citrus juices. Superfine sugar (also called bar sugar, a nod to its use by bartenders) is best for making simple syrup because the fine granules dissolve easily without heating. There are two methods for making simple syrup: hot and cold. Most people are familiar with the hot method and do not realize that you can get the same result by simply stirring or shaking it. The cold method works only with superfine sugar. Standard granulated sugar requires heat to thoroughly dissolve all the granules. Either way, the sugar and water proportions are the same–one to one by volume; because there is a lot of air trapped between granules of sugar, we recommend measuring by weight. For those who don't own a kitchen scale, we offer a volume measurement as well. Makes 1 quart."
    ingredients: 
    - 1½ pounds (3⅓ cups) superfine sugar
    - 2 cups water
    steps:
    - "Hot Method: Combine the sugar and water in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring continuously. Let the syrup cool, then store in a quart bottle."
    - "Cold Method: Using a funnel, pour the sugar into a quart bottle. Add the water in small increments, capping and shaking between additions to loosen the sugar and free the trapped air. Once all the water has been added, continue to rotate the bottle until all the sugar is dissolved."
    - Store in the refrigerator. It will firm up when cold, so allow to return to room temperature before using. The syrup will keep for 4 days, refrigerated.
  - name: Demerara Simple Syrup
    notes: |+2
      Makes 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 pound demerara sugar
    - 2 cups water
    steps:
    - Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. 
    - Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. 
    - Let cool, then store in a bottle. 
    - The syrup will keep for 4 days, refrigerated.
  - name: Honey Syrup
    notes: |+2
      When added straight from the bottle or jar, honey does not work well in chilled cocktails. It will stick to the sides of the shaker when the ice is introduced and will resist mixing. If you want the flavor of honey in cocktails, you must first dilute its texture, make it soluble, and make it into a syrup. Most honey syrups contain just honey and water, but we have added vanilla and orange peel to accentuate some of the key flavor notes in the honey. Acacia honey is light in flavor and fragrant and is one of the few honeys that is truly liquid and does not crystallize. This particular recipe was developed for our Mediterra cocktail, which was one of the most popular cocktails in the first years after Employees Only opened. Makes 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 3 cups water
    - 1½ cups acacia honey
    - Peel of 1 orange, removed in large strips
    - 1 whole vanilla bean, scored and scraped
    steps:
    - Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat, bring to a boil, and let simmer for 5 minutes. 
    - Let cool, then strain into a food-safe quart container for storing. 
    - Fill a labeled squeeze bottle for easiest use. 
    - The syrup will keep for 7 days, refrigerated.
  - name: Fresh Pineapple Syrup
    notes: |+2
      Pineapple syrup is a very simple affair and a tasty sweetener made for use in the Pisco Punch. The flavor experience is different from using juice or fruit, because although it is clean, it picks up much of the vegetal characteristics of the pineapple. This syrup has many applications and can substitute for simple syrup to add more depth in tropical cocktails. Makes 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 cups fresh pineapple cubes
    - 1 quart simple syrup
    steps:
    - Combine the fruit and syrup in a large food-safe container and refrigerate for 72 hours. 
    - Strain the syrup and discard the pineapple. 
    - Fill a labeled squeeze bottle for easiest use. 
    - The syrup will keep for 7 days, refrigerated.
  - name: Mint Syrup
    notes: |+2
      In many antiquated recipes for this Southern specialty, infusing mint syrup is a necessary step in making a proper Mint Julep. This is a very simple ingredient to make and will greatly enhance the flavor of the cocktails you use it in. It is traditionally used as an ingredient in juleps and smashes. Makes 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - About 50 fresh mint leaves
    - 1 quart simple syrup
    steps:
    - Carefully and lightly bruise the mint leaves with a muddler or the back of a wooden spoon in a food-safe container. 
    - Pour the syrup over the leaves, cover, and refrigerate for 4 hours. 
    - Strain and keep refrigerated. 
    - Fill a labeled squeeze bottle for easiest use. 
    - The syrup will keep for about 3 days.
  - name: Spicy Ginger Beer
    notes: |+2
      Ginger beer is often made as a live fermented brew, a time-consuming and messy process–our method shortcuts time, but not flavor. For a controlled version of premade ginger beer, use a soda siphon to provide carbonation. Makes about 4 quarts.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 pounds fresh gingerroot, peeled and coarsely chopped
    - 1 English cucumber, unpeeled and coarsely chopped
    - 2 fresh red chiles, chopped
    - 1 cup fresh mint leaves
    - 1 cup turbinado sugar
    - ¾ cup acacia honey
    - 2 cups water
    - ¼ cup freshly squeezed lime juice
    - 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
    - Chilled club soda, or water if using a soda siphon
    steps:
    - Place the ginger and cucumber in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. 
    - Pour them along with any juice into a large saucepan over medium heat and add the chilies, mint leaves, sugar, honey, water, juice, peppercorns, and soda. 
    - Bring to a boil and simmer for 15 minutes until the liquid becomes syrupy enough to coat the back of a spoon. 
    - Remove from the heat and let cool overnight. 
    - Strain the ginger beer through a fine-mesh sieve into a food-safe container and refrigerate; it will keep for 4 days, refrigerated.
    - The ratio of syrup to club soda is 1:3 when made to order. 
    - If using a soda siphon, pour 1 cup syrup and 3 cups water into a 1-liter soda siphon.
  - name: Grenadine
    notes: |+2
      Grenadine has suffered a tragic alteration at the hand of commercial producers, who have made it into an artificially flavored and colored, high-fructose corn syrup travesty that has nothing to do with the fruit for which it is named. (The word “grenadine” comes from the Spanish word for pomegranate, grenada.) Determined to revive the real deal, we crafted our own recipe using POM Wonderful pomegranate juice. We fortify it with Cardenal Mendoza aged Spanish brandy to help preserve it and add an additional depth of flavor. Alternatively, try our Employees Only brand (see the Resources section). Makes about 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 2½ cups pomegranate juice
    - 1 cup simple syrup
    - ½ cup Cardenal Mendoza or other dark-rich brandy
    steps:
    - Pour the pomegranate juice and syrup into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. 
    - Decrease the heat to low and reduce the mixture until it becomes syrupy enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes. 
    - Let cool and add the brandy. 
    - Pour into a food-safe container and store in the refrigerator until needed. 
    - Fill a labeled squeeze bottle for easiest use. 
    - Grenadine will keep for 2 weeks, refrigerated.
  - name: Lime Cordial
    notes: |+2
      Unfortunately, most lime cordials on the market today are some of the nastiest artificial garbage you could put into your body. With no strong-flavored natural options, many bartenders have been making their Gimlets with fresh lime juice and simple syrup. Yet without the bitterness of the lime oils, a fresh Gimlet falls flat. We have created an alternative using lime juice and agave nectar and flavored with the oils of kaffir lime leaf. Kaffir lime leaves are traditionally used in Thai cooking and have a wonderful aroma. Lime leaves can be found in Asian markets and some specialty stores such as Whole Foods. You can also buy our Employees Only brand (see the Resources section). Makes about 1⅓ quarts.
    ingredients: 
    - 4 cups freshly squeezed lime juice
    - 2½ cups raw light agave nectar
    - 40 kaffir lime leaves, heavily bruised to release flavor
    steps:
    - Place all the ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat. 
    - Bring to a boil, then decrease the heat to low. 
    - Simmer until the mixture becomes syrupy enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 35 minutes. 
    - Using a slotted spoon, scoop out all the leaves and any scum that may have risen to the surface. 
    - Strain through a fine-mesh sieve and store in a food-safe container. 
    - Keep refrigerated until use. 
    - Lime cordial will keep for 7 days, refrigerated. 
    - Fill a labeled squeeze bottle for easiest use.
  - name: Wild Strawberry Cordial
    notes: |+2
      Our wild strawberry cordial is actually somewhere between a fruit purée and a syrup. The idea was to create a high-octane strawberry flavor to blend in a French 75 cocktail. Much of the flavor comes from the wild strawberries we have imported frozen from France–they are tiny in size but big in flavor and vary from light yellow to deep red. You can use regular fresh strawberries, but make absolutely certain that they are ripe and fragrant. Makes about 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 4 pounds frozen or fresh strawberries, hulled
    - 1 cup granulated sugar
    - 1 cup water
    - Grated zest of ½ lemon
    - 1 vanilla bean, scored and scraped
    steps:
    - Place all the ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. 
    - Bring to a boil, stirring, then decrease the heat to low and simmer for about 25 minutes. 
    - Remove from the heat and let cool. 
    - Strain out the lemon zest and vanilla bean and pour into a store-and-pour container. 
    - The cordial will keep for 7 days, refrigerated. 
    - Keep refrigerated until use. 
    - Fill a labeled squeeze bottle for easiest use.
  - name: Hisbiscus Cordial
    notes: |+2
      Hibiscus is used throughout the Middle East and Latin America to make a ruby-red herbal tea. You can find the flowers at a tea or herb retailer. This hibiscus cordial is the brainchild of our bar manager and long-time friend Robert Krueger. This cleverly designed cordial brings out a rich color, beautiful floral notes, and a nice citrus flavor from the dried hibiscus flowers. It's the main ingredient in Rob's Roselle cocktail. Vodka and brandy serve to fortify the cordial for longer use. Makes about 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 cups water
    - ½ cup dried hibiscus flowers
    - 1½ pounds superfine sugar
    - 2½ ounces 100-proof vodka
    - 2½ ounces VS cognac
    steps:
    - Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. 
    - Decrease the heat and add the hibiscus flowers and sugar; stir until the sugar is entirely dissolved. 
    - Remove from the heat and allow to cool. 
    - Add the vodka and cognac, then strain and bottle immediately.
  - name: Vermouth de Provence
    notes: |+2
      When first conceiving Employees Only, we knew we wanted to create our own house vermouths. We abandoned the idea of making our vermouth from raw wine and decided instead to use dry vermouth as a base for an infusion of additional herbs. The primary flavors in dry vermouth are rosemary, thyme, lavender, and anise–the same botanicals that make up the herbes de Provence blend used in cooking. To extract and transfuse flavors, we use a hot infusion method to create just a small amount of highly concentrated liquid that can be blended with the rest of a bottle of vermouth without cooking out all the alcohol. This controlled method of infusing reduces the amount of contact between alcohol and herbs–if left to steep too long, the finish is bitter. EO Vermouth de Provence is one of the key ingredients in the Provençal cocktail. Makes 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 tablespoons herbes de Provence
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle Noilly Prat dry vermouth
    steps:
    - Place the herbes de Provence in a small saucepan over medium heat for 2 minutes, or until fragrant. 
    - Add 2 cups of the vermouth. 
    - Bring to a boil and immediately remove from the heat. 
    - Let stand until cool. 
    - Add the remaining vermouth and strain through cheesecloth. 
    - Bottle and store at room temperature. 
    - Will keep indefinitely.
  - name: Chai-Infused Sweet Vermouth
    notes: |+2
      Whereas dry vermouths are herbal, sweet vermouths are spice driven. When we decided to formulate our own sweet vermouth infusion with a deep, accentuated spiciness, we found the perfect warmth and fragrance in chai–the much-loved blend of black tea, cardamom, clove, cinnamon, and ginger. The resulting flavor is so sexy that you will feel like you have been kissed by a Bollywood beauty. This intoxicating concoction is the defining ingredient in our Mata Hari cocktail. Makes 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 4 green cardamom pods
    - 4 whole cloves
    - 1 cinnamon stick
    - 1 tablespoon peeled, coarsely chopped gingerroot
    - 1 tablespoon loose-leaf chai tea
    - 1 (1-liter) bottle Cinzano sweet vermouth
    steps:
    - Place the cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger in a small saucepan over low heat and heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
    - Add the tea and 1 cup of the vermouth. 
    - Bring to a low boil for 2 minutes. 
    - Remove from the heat and let cool completely. 
    - Add the remaining vermouth and strain the mixture through cheesecloth. 
    - Bottle and store at room temperature. 
    - Will keep indefinitely.
  - name: Red Bush-Infused Vermouth
    notes: |+2
      This tea-infused vermouth was developed by EO bartender Milos Zica for the Quiet Storm cocktail. Also known as rooibos, South African red bush tea is a robust herbal tea with a rich mahogany color. We recommend the Silence rooibos tea blend from T Salon, which is where the cocktail's name partially derives from. Like the Vermouth de Provence, this vermouth is created with the hot infusion method that requires steeping the tea and other ingredients in a small amount of vermouth to make a concentrate. The color of this infused vermouth is a rich pumpkin orange. Makes ¾ quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle Dolin Blanc vermouth
    - 1 tablespoon T Salon Silence red rooibos tea
    - Peel of 1 lemon, in strips
    steps:
    - Pour 1 cup of the vermouth into a small saucepan over low heat. 
    - Add the tea and slowly bring to a boil, then remove immediately from the heat. 
    - Squeeze the lemon peel over the mixture, then drop it in. 
    - Stir gently and allow to cool for 30 minutes. 
    - Strain the infusion through cheesecloth into the vermouth bottle with the remaining vermouth. 
    - Store at room temperature. 
    - Will keep indefinitely.
  - name: Lavender-Infused Gin
    notes: |+2
      Plymouth gin has a slightly floral nature. We accentuated it with dried lavender, creating a fast and versatile infusion with many possibilities. This infusion is visually stunning–the herb colors the gin with a slight hue of dark lavender. We use it as the base for our Provençal cocktail and recommend it for making a lavender fizz or even an Aviation cocktail made with lemon juice, maraschino liqueur, and infused gin. Makes 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 2 teaspoons organic dried lavender
    - 1 (1-liter) bottle Plymouth gin
    steps:
    - Place the lavender in a small saucepan over low heat. 
    - Add 2 cups of the gin and bring to a boil. 
    - Immediately remove from the heat and allow to cool. 
    - Add the remaining gin. 
    - Strain the mixture through cheesecloth into a bottle and discard the lavender. 
    - Store at room temperature away from sunlight. 
    - Will keep indefinitely.
  - name: Peach-Infused Bourbon
    notes: |+2
      Peaches and bourbon is about as Southern as you can get. Drying the fruit before steeping is key–the flavors are concentrated and yield a strong, clean peach essence; fresh fruit, on the other hand, releases its water into the liquid and dilutes the infusion. The only problem with dried peaches is that they will soak up some of the bourbon, resulting in some loss, but it is worth it. Today, high-quality dried peaches are available in most supermarkets, which greatly simplifies the process. When the infused bourbon is tasted straight, the fruit flavor may seem subdued, but mixing it with sugar or sweetened ingredients awakens the peachiness. We created this infusion for our Pêche Bourbon cocktail. Makes ¾ quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 12 dried organic unsulphured peach halves
    - 1 (1-liter) bottle Maker's Mark bourbon
    steps:
    - Place the peaches and bourbon in a large covered glass container or cookie jar. Let rest for 3 days, then strain into the bottle. Store at room temperature. Will keep indefinitely.
  - name: English Bourbon
    notes: |+2
      How to Mix Drinks or the Bon Vivant's Companion offers a recipe for English Bishop that involves sketchy directions and an open fire. It took some trial and error, but we adapted it to a standard oven. The infusion can be a cocktail sipped on its own, or an ingredient that can be mixed into other cocktails; we use it in our Jersey Devil cocktail. Makes about ¾ quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 orange
    - 30 whole cloves
    - 1 (750 ml) bottle ruby port
    - 1 cup superfine sugar
    steps:
    - Preheat the oven to 400°F. 
    - Stud the orange with the cloves, place in a baking dish, and bake until the entire orange is browned, about 30 minutes. 
    - While still warm, carefully cut into quarters and place in a saucepan over medium heat. 
    - Add the port and simmer for 30 minutes. 
    - Remove the orange quarters, strain the liquid, and add the sugar. 
    - Allow to cool, strain out any debris, and bottle. 
    - Will keep for 2 weeks, refrigerated.
  - name: Absinthe Bitters
    notes: |+2
      Poring through old cocktail books, we noted that every reputable bar had a house recipe for bitters. Originally we played with infusing bitter herbs and spices in absinthe but found the task too time-consuming and the results too inconsistent. We settled instead on a blend of different absinthes, Green Chartreuse, and bitters to create just the right balance of anise and bitterness. Makes 1 quart.
    ingredients: 
    - 3 cups Pernod 68 absinthe
    - ½ cup Green Chartreuse
    - 1 teaspoon Peychaud's bitters
    - 1 teaspoon Angostura bitters
    - 2 tablespoons Fee Brothers mint bitters
    steps:
    - Combine all the ingredients in a liter bottle using a funnel. 
    - Cover or cork the bottle and gently turn it upside down three times to blend thoroughly. 
    - Store at room temperature. 
    - Will keep indefinitely.

  - name: Employees Only Chicken Soup
    notes: |+2
      Every night around 4 a.m. at Employees Only, we offer up a hot cup of chunky chicken soup to the survivors of the long, cruel night. It is a tradition came by way of Greek night clubs. It is how we say “thank you” and “good night” to all the people who might expect one more drink. Makes 4½ to 5 quarts.
    ingredients: 
    - 1 whole chicken, about 3½ pounds, rinsed
    - 1 onion, cut into quarters
    - 1 carrot, peeled and cut in half lengthwise
    - 1 celery stalk, cut in half lengthwise
    - 8 whole cloves garlic
    - 2 bay leaves, preferably fresh
    - 3 star anise
    - 2 whole cloves
    - 1 cinnamon stick
    - 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
    - 1 teaspoon cardamom pods
    - 3 tablespoons olive oil
    - 1 small onion, diced
    - 1 carrot, peeled and diced
    - 2 celery stalks, diced
    - Salt and freshly ground black pepper
    steps:
    - Place the chicken, onion, carrot, and celery in a large pot and pour in 3 quarts of water (the chicken should be completely submerged). Add the garlic, bay leaves, star anise, cinnamon, red pepper flakes, and cardamom. Bring to a boil over high heat, then decrease the heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked all the way through.
    - Remove the chicken from the pot and place it on a cutting board. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a smaller pot and discard the solids. When the chicken is cool, remove the skin and cut the meat from the bones. Discard the skin and bones, cut the meat into bite-size pieces, and add them back to the broth. Bring the soup to a gentle simmer.
    - Meanwhile, in a sauté pan, heat the olive oil. Add the diced onion, carrot, and celery and sauté until tender, 6 to 10 minutes. Add the onion, carrot, and celery to the soup, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve when drunk.
