#Gin and Tonic
  - name: Simple Syrup
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 125g sugar
    - 125g water
    steps:
    - Combine sugar and water in a medium bowl. Stir with spatula to completely dissolve sugar. Transfer to a glass bottle and reserve in the refrigerator.
  - name: Cucumber Spheres
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 1000g filtered water
    - 7.5g sodium alginate
    - 4 English cucumbers
    - 108g sugar
    - 20g calcium lactate
    - 6g kosher salt
    steps:
    - To make sodium alginate bath, combine water and sodium alginate in a large bowl. Blend with an immersion blender at high speed until alginate dissolves and no clumps remain. Strain through chinois into a clean bowl. Let the bath sit at least 1 hour or overnight to allow sodium alginate to fully hydrate and bubbles to dissipate.
    - To make cucumber base, quarter cucumbers lengthwise (leaving peel on), slice into small pieces, and juice in juicer. Strain juice through chinois. Combine 1000g cucumber juice, sugar, calcium lactate, and salt in a medium bowl. Blend with an immersion blender until the powders are completely dissolved.
    - Fill 5/8” hemispherical molds with mixture. You will need approximately 100 hemispheres per cocktail, or 600 total for this recipe. Freeze until completely solid. Reserve remaining cucumber juice mixture in an airtight container.
    - To make cucumber spheres, fill two bowls with cold tap water. Warm alginate bath gently over low heat or in the microwave, taking care not to allow bubbles to form. Working in small batches, remove frozen hemispheres from the freezer and disperse evenly in a sodium alginate bath, agitating both gently and taking care that spheres do not touch one another or stick to the bottom of the bowl. As spheres thaw, they will form a membrane that will encapsulate the liquid center.
    - When spheres have fully encapsulated, remove with a perforated spoon and drop into a bowl of cold water. Stir gently to rinse. Repeat in the second bowl. Remove any misshapen spheres. Transfer spheres to a container of reserved cucumber juice.

    steps:
    - Combine truffles and water in a pressure cooker. Using an immersion blender, blend for 45 seconds. Tightly fasten lid on pressure cooker and set pressure gauge for 10 pounds. Slowly bring to a simmer. When steam begins to escape from the cooker, reduce heat to low and cook for 30 minutes. Remove from heat. Release pressure valve and unfasten lid. Fill a large bowl with ice water, and set a smaller bowl inside it. Pour stock and solids into a bowl over ice and let cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate at least overnight or for up to 3 days for maximum flavor extraction. Strain through chinois, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Transfer to a glass bottle and reserve in the refrigerator.
    - This recipe makes notably more stock than is needed for this drink, but we chose not to scale it down to avoid the risk of scorching the stock as it cooks. The excess stock can be refrigerated or frozen for other uses (or, make several batches of this cocktail and store them in glass bottles in your fridge).

    - 50g sugar
    steps:
    - Combine purée and sugar in a small bowl, stirring to dissolve sugar. Transfer to a glass bottle. Reserve in the refrigerator.
    - We use a frozen purée for large-scale consistency, but fresh, ripe mangoes could easily be used instead if they’re available to you. Doing this will introduce some variation in sweetness; you’ll need to rely a bit more on your sense of taste to balance the final cocktail properly.
  - name: Coriander Salt
    notes: 
    ingredients: 
    - 20g coriander seeds
    - 20g bourbon barrel smoked sea salt
    steps:
    - In a small, dry skillet, toast coriander over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until very fragrant.

    - The coriander and salt tend to grind differently; we handle them separately to ensure the final powder includes equal measures of each after the sifting step. This recipe yields more than is needed for this drink, as smaller amounts of each ingredient are harder to grind well.

    - To make suga base, prepare an ice bath. In a small saucepan, bring 380g water to a boil. In a small mixing bowl, combine sugars and calcium lactate, stirring to mix thoroughly. Add mixture to boiling water, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Remove from heat and set in the ice bath until chilled. Fill 5/8” hemispherical mold with mixture.

    - To make crème de menthe spheres, fill two bowls with cold tap water. Warm alginate bath gently over low heat or in the microwave, taking care not to allow bubbles to form. Working in small batches, remove frozen hemispheres from the freezer and disperse evenly in a sodium alginate bath, agitating both gently and taking care that spheres do not touch one another or stick to the bottom of the bowl. As spheres thaw, they will form a membrane that will encapsulate the liquid center. When spheres have fully encapsulated, remove with a perforated spoon and drop into a bowl of cold water. Stir gently to rinse. Repeat in the second bowl. Remove any misshapen spheres. Transfer spheres to a small container, and cover with crème de menthe. Reserve for at least 4 hours to allow liqueur to infuse into spheres.

The whiskey may lead to problems when freezing this ice at home, however, if your freezer isn’t quite cold enough. One solution to this might be lowering the amount of whiskey to firm up the ice."

    ingredients: 
    - 9qt water
    - 4.2lb pilsner malt
    - 2lb wheat malt
    - 10.4oz acidulated malt
    - 15qt water
    - 1oz acidulated malt
    - 0.13oz Magnum hops
    - 4.25oz Wyeast 1056 American Ale liquid yeast
    - 2.5oz Citra hops
    - 1.5oz togarashi
    - 0.5oz yuzu juice
    steps:
    - To make the grain mash, heat 9qt water in a large pot to 168°F (76°C). Using a grain mill, coarsel;y grind malted grains. Place the pilsner malt, wheat malt, and 10.4oz acidulated malt into a large mesh bag, tying the mouth of the bag tightly with twine to close securely. Add the grain bag to the heated water. Adjust heat as needed to maintain a steady temperature of 150-158°F (66-70°C) for 1 hour.
    - Meanwhile, to make sparge water, heat 15qt water in a separate large pot to 170°F (77°C). When the grain has completed mashing, lift the grain bag from the water. Set a large colander over the mouth of the pot, and rest the bag in the colander to drain. Carefully pour heated sparge water over the grain bag in small amounts to rinse grains. Remove the grain bag and colander. Add remaining acidulated malt, cover pot, and lower heat to maintain temperature at 105-110°F (40-45°C) for 3 days.
    - After this time, check the volume of liquid, adding water as necessary to bring the liquid amount of approximately 6 gallons. Bring the liquid to a boil, add Magnum hops, and boil vigorously for 1 hour, or until liquid has reduced to 5 gallons. Remove from heat. Transfer pot to a large ice bath or use an immersion chiller to lower the temperature of liquid to 70-75°F (21-24°C). Strain into a sanitized fermentation container. Add yeast, stirring vigorously with a large sanitized spoon to combine. Cap fermentation container with an airlock, and allow to ferment at 65°F for 4-6 days.
    - When fermentation slows, add Citra hops, togarashi, and yuzu juice. Allow the fermentation to complete and yeast to settle for an additional 7 days.
    - "To finish in keg: Use a siphon to gently transfer fermented beer into sanitized keg, taking care to avoid excessively splashing liquid and to leave as much sediment behind as possible. Close the keg and pressurize with CO2 canister to approximately 11 PSI. Transfer keg to the refrigerator, maintaining CO2 pressure for 7-10 days. Check the carbonation levels, adjusting canister pressure as necessary."
    - "To finish in bottles: combine 16oz water and 4.5oz dextrose in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, whisking to dissolve sugar completely. Transfer to a large sanitized container. Use the siphon to gently transfer fermented beer into the container, taking care to avoid excessively splashing liquid and to leave as much sediment behind as possible.
